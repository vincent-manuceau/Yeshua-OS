<span id="index-Assembly-loop-unrolling"></span>

<p>Loop unrolling consists of replicating code so that several limbs are
processed in each loop.  At a minimum this reduces loop overheads by a
corresponding factor, but it can also allow better register usage, for example
alternately using one register combination and then another.  Judicious use of
<code>m4</code> macros can help avoid lots of duplication in the source code.
</p>
<p>Any amount of unrolling can be handled with a loop counter that&rsquo;s decremented
by <em class='math'>N</em> each time, stopping when the remaining count is less than the
further <em class='math'>N</em> the loop will process.  Or by subtracting <em class='math'>N</em> at the
start, the termination condition becomes when the counter <em class='math'>C</em> is less
than 0 (and the count of remaining limbs is <em class='math'>C+N</em>).
</p>
<p>Alternately for a power of 2 unroll the loop count and remainder can be
established with a shift and mask.  This is convenient if also making a
computed jump into the middle of a large loop.
</p>
<p>The limbs not a multiple of the unrolling can be handled in various ways, for
example
</p>
<ul>
<li> A simple loop at the end (or the start) to process the excess.  Care will be
wanted that it isn&rsquo;t too much slower than the unrolled part.

</li><li> A set of binary tests, for example after an 8-limb unrolling, test for 4 more
limbs to process, then a further 2 more or not, and finally 1 more or not.
This will probably take more code space than a simple loop.

</li><li> A <code>switch</code> statement, providing separate code for each possible excess,
for example an 8-limb unrolling would have separate code for 0 remaining, 1
remaining, etc, up to 7 remaining.  This might take a lot of code, but may be
the best way to optimize all cases in combination with a deep pipelined loop.

</li><li> A computed jump into the middle of the loop, thus making the first iteration
handle the excess.  This should make times smoothly increase with size, which
is attractive, but setups for the jump and adjustments for pointers can be
tricky and could become quite difficult in combination with deep pipelining.
</li></ul>
