<span id="Archiving-Directories"></span><h4 class="subsection">2.6.5 Archiving Directories</h4>

<span id="index-Archiving-Directories"></span>
<span id="index-Directories_002c-Archiving"></span>
<p>You can archive a directory by specifying its directory name as a
file name argument to <code>tar</code>.  The files in the directory will be
archived relative to the working directory, and the directory will be
re-created along with its contents when the archive is extracted.
</p>
<p>To archive a directory, first move to its superior directory.  If you
have followed the previous instructions in this tutorial, you should
type:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>cd ..</kbd>
$
</pre></div>

<p>This will put you into the directory which contains <samp>practice</samp>,
i.e., your home directory.  Once in the superior directory, you can
specify the subdirectory, <samp>practice</samp>, as a file name argument.  To
store <samp>practice</samp> in the new archive file <samp>music.tar</samp>, type:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar --create --verbose --file=music.tar practice</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p><code>tar</code> should output:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">practice/
practice/blues
practice/folk
practice/jazz
practice/collection.tar
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the archive thus created is not in the subdirectory
<samp>practice</samp>, but rather in the current working directory&mdash;the
directory from which <code>tar</code> was invoked.  Before trying to archive a
directory from its superior directory, you should make sure you have
write access to the superior directory itself, not only the directory
you are trying archive with <code>tar</code>.  For example, you will probably
not be able to store your home directory in an archive by invoking
<code>tar</code> from the root directory; See <a href="absolute.html">Absolute File Names</a>.  (Note
also that <samp>collection.tar</samp>, the original archive file, has itself
been archived.  <code>tar</code> will accept any file as a file to be
archived, regardless of its content.  When <samp>music.tar</samp> is
extracted, the archive file <samp>collection.tar</samp> will be re-written
into the file system).
</p>
<p>If you give <code>tar</code> a command such as
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar --create --file=foo.tar .</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p><code>tar</code> will report &lsquo;<samp>tar: ./foo.tar is the archive; not
dumped</samp>&rsquo;.  This happens because <code>tar</code> creates the archive
<samp>foo.tar</samp> in the current directory before putting any files into
it.  Then, when <code>tar</code> attempts to add all the files in the
directory <samp>.</samp> to the archive, it notices that the file
<samp>./foo.tar</samp> is the same as the archive <samp>foo.tar</samp>, and skips
it.  (It makes no sense to put an archive into itself.)  <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code>
will continue in this case, and create the archive
normally, except for the exclusion of that one file.  (<em>Please
note:</em> Other implementations of <code>tar</code> may not be so clever;
they will enter an infinite loop when this happens, so you should not
depend on this behavior unless you are certain you are running
<acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code>.  In general, it is wise to always place the archive outside
of the directory being dumped.)
