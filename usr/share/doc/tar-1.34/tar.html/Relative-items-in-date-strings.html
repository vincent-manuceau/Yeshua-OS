<span id="Relative-items-in-date-strings-1"></span><h3 class="section">7.7 Relative items in date strings</h3>

<span id="index-relative-items-in-date-strings"></span>
<span id="index-displacement-of-dates"></span>

<p><em>Relative items</em> adjust a date (or the current date if none) forward
or backward.  The effects of relative items accumulate.  Here are some
examples:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">1 year
1 year ago
3 years
2 days
</pre></div>

<span id="index-year-in-date-strings"></span>
<span id="index-month-in-date-strings"></span>
<span id="index-fortnight-in-date-strings"></span>
<span id="index-week-in-date-strings"></span>
<span id="index-day-in-date-strings"></span>
<span id="index-hour-in-date-strings"></span>
<span id="index-minute-in-date-strings"></span>
<p>The unit of time displacement may be selected by the string &lsquo;<samp>year</samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp>month</samp>&rsquo; for moving by whole years or months.  These are fuzzy
units, as years and months are not all of equal duration.  More precise
units are &lsquo;<samp>fortnight</samp>&rsquo; which is worth 14 days, &lsquo;<samp>week</samp>&rsquo; worth 7
days, &lsquo;<samp>day</samp>&rsquo; worth 24 hours, &lsquo;<samp>hour</samp>&rsquo; worth 60 minutes,
&lsquo;<samp>minute</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>min</samp>&rsquo; worth 60 seconds, and &lsquo;<samp>second</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>sec</samp>&rsquo; worth one second.  An &lsquo;<samp>s</samp>&rsquo; suffix on these units is
accepted and ignored.
</p>
<span id="index-ago-in-date-strings"></span>
<p>The unit of time may be preceded by a multiplier, given as an optionally
signed number.  Unsigned numbers are taken as positively signed.  No
number at all implies 1 for a multiplier.  Following a relative item by
the string &lsquo;<samp>ago</samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to preceding the unit by a
multiplier with value <em class='math'>-1</em>.
</p>
<span id="index-day-in-date-strings-1"></span>
<span id="index-tomorrow-in-date-strings"></span>
<span id="index-yesterday-in-date-strings"></span>
<p>The string &lsquo;<samp>tomorrow</samp>&rsquo; is worth one day in the future (equivalent
to &lsquo;<samp>day</samp>&rsquo;), the string &lsquo;<samp>yesterday</samp>&rsquo; is worth
one day in the past (equivalent to &lsquo;<samp>day ago</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
<span id="index-now-in-date-strings"></span>
<span id="index-today-in-date-strings"></span>
<span id="index-this-in-date-strings"></span>
<p>The strings &lsquo;<samp>now</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>today</samp>&rsquo; are relative items corresponding
to zero-valued time displacement, these strings come from the fact
a zero-valued time displacement represents the current time when not
otherwise changed by previous items.  They may be used to stress other
items, like in &lsquo;<samp>12:00 today</samp>&rsquo;.  The string &lsquo;<samp>this</samp>&rsquo; also has
the meaning of a zero-valued time displacement, but is preferred in
date strings like &lsquo;<samp>this thursday</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>When a relative item causes the resulting date to cross a boundary
where the clocks were adjusted, typically for daylight saving time,
the resulting date and time are adjusted accordingly.
</p>
<p>The fuzz in units can cause problems with relative items.  For
example, &lsquo;<samp>2020-07-31 -1 month</samp>&rsquo; might evaluate to 2020-07-01,
because 2020-06-31 is an invalid date.  To determine the previous
month more reliably, you can ask for the month before the 15th of the
current month.  For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ date -R
Thu, 31 Jul 2020 13:02:39 -0400
$ date --date='-1 month' +'Last month was %B?'
Last month was July?
$ date --date=&quot;$(date +%Y-%m-15) -1 month&quot; +'Last month was %B!'
Last month was June!
</pre></div>

<p>Also, take care when manipulating dates around clock changes such as
daylight saving leaps.  In a few cases these have added or subtracted
as much as 24 hours from the clock, so it is often wise to adopt
universal time by setting the <code>TZ</code> environment variable to
&lsquo;<samp>UTC0</samp>&rsquo; before embarking on calendrical calculations.
