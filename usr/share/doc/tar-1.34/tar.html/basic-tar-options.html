<span id="Basic-tar-Operations-and-Options"></span><h3 class="section">2.3 Basic <code>tar</code> Operations and Options</h3>

<p><code>tar</code> can take a wide variety of arguments which specify and define
the actions it will have on the particular set of files or the archive.
The main types of arguments to <code>tar</code> fall into one of two classes:
operations, and options.
</p>
<p>Some arguments fall into a class called <em>operations</em>; exactly one of
these is both allowed and required for any instance of using <code>tar</code>;
you may <em>not</em> specify more than one.  People sometimes speak of
<em>operating modes</em>.  You are in a particular operating mode when you
have specified the operation which specifies it; there are eight
operations in total, and thus there are eight operating modes.
</p>
<p>The other arguments fall into the class known as <em>options</em>.  You are
not required to specify any options, and you are allowed to specify more
than one at a time (depending on the way you are using <code>tar</code> at
that time).  Some options are used so frequently, and are so useful for
helping you type commands more carefully that they are effectively
&ldquo;required&rdquo;.  We will discuss them in this chapter.
</p>
<p>You can write most of the <code>tar</code> operations and options in any
of three forms: long (mnemonic) form, short form, and old style.  Some
of the operations and options have no short or &ldquo;old&rdquo; forms; however,
the operations and options which we will cover in this tutorial have
corresponding abbreviations.  We will indicate those abbreviations
appropriately to get you used to seeing them.  Note, that the &ldquo;old
style&rdquo; option forms exist in <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> for compatibility with Unix
<code>tar</code>.  In this book we present a full discussion of this way
of writing options and operations (see <a href="Old-Options.html">Old Option Style</a>), and we discuss
the other two styles of writing options (See <a href="Long-Options.html">Long Option Style</a>, and
see <a href="Short-Options.html">Short Option Style</a>).
</p>
<p>In the examples and in the text of this tutorial, we usually use the
long forms of operations and options; but the &ldquo;short&rdquo; forms produce
the same result and can make typing long <code>tar</code> commands easier.
For example, instead of typing
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>tar --create --verbose --file=afiles.tar apple angst aspic</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>you can type
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>tar -c -v -f afiles.tar apple angst aspic</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>or even
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>tar -cvf afiles.tar apple angst aspic</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>For more information on option syntax, see <a href="Advanced-tar.html">Advanced <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> Operations</a>.  In
discussions in the text, when we name an option by its long form, we
also give the corresponding short option in parentheses.
</p>
<p>The term, &ldquo;option&rdquo;, can be confusing at times, since &ldquo;operations&rdquo;
are often lumped in with the actual, <em>optional</em> &ldquo;options&rdquo; in certain
general class statements.  For example, we just talked about &ldquo;short and
long forms of options and operations&rdquo;.  However, experienced <code>tar</code>
users often refer to these by shorthand terms such as, &ldquo;short and long
options&rdquo;.  This term assumes that the &ldquo;operations&rdquo; are included, also.
Context will help you determine which definition of &ldquo;options&rdquo; to use.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the term &ldquo;command&rdquo; can be confusing, as it is often used in
two different ways.  People sometimes refer to <code>tar</code> &ldquo;commands&rdquo;.
A <code>tar</code> <em>command</em> is the entire command line of user input
which tells <code>tar</code> what to do &mdash; including the operation, options,
and any arguments (file names, pipes, other commands, etc.).  However,
you will also sometimes hear the term &ldquo;the <code>tar</code> command&rdquo;.  When
the word &ldquo;command&rdquo; is used specifically like this, a person is usually
referring to the <code>tar</code> <em>operation</em>, not the whole line.
Again, use context to figure out which of the meanings the speaker
intends.
