1 Introduction

1.1 What is DejaGnu?
====================

DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs, providing a single
front-end for all tests.  You can think of it as a library of Tcl
procedures to help with writing a test harness.  A _test harness_ is the
infrastructure that is created to test a specific program or tool.  Each
program can have multiple testsuites, all supported by a single test
harness.  DejaGnu is written in Expect, which in turn uses Tcl, the Tool
command language.  There is more information on Tcl at the Tcl/Tk web
site (http://www.tcl.tk) and the Expect web site
(http://expect.nist.gov).

   Julia Menapace first coined the term _DejaGnu_ to describe an earlier
testing framework she wrote at Cygnus Support for testing GDB. When we
replaced it with the Expect-based framework, it was like DejaGnu all
over again.  More importantly, it was also named after my daughter, Deja
Snow Savoye, who was a toddler during DejaGnu's beginnings.

   DejaGnu offers several advantages for testing:

   * The flexibility and consistency of the DejaGnu framework make it
     easy to write tests for any program, with either batch-oriented, or
     interactive programs.

   * DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction which allows you to write
     tests that are portable to any host or target where a program must
     be tested.  For instance, a test for 'GDB' can run from any
     supported host system on any supported target system.  DejaGnu runs
     tests on many single board computers, whose operating software
     ranges from a simple boot monitor to a real-time OS.

   * All tests have the same output format.  This makes it easy to
     integrate testing into other software development processes.
     DejaGnu's output is designed to be parsed by other filtering script
     and it is also human readable.

   * Using Tcl and Expect, it's easy to create wrappers for existing
     testsuites.  By incorporating existing tests under DejaGnu, it's
     easier to have a single set of report analyse programs..

   Running tests requires two things: the testing framework and the
testsuites themselves.  Tests are usually written in Expect using Tcl,
but you can also use a Tcl script to run a testsuite that is not based
on Expect.  Expect script filenames conventionally use '.exp' as a
suffix.  For example, the main implementation of the DejaGnu test driver
is in the file 'runtest.exp'.

1.2 New in this release
=======================

The following major, user-visible changes have been introduced since
version 1.5.3.

  1. Support for target communication via SSH has been added.

  2. A large number of very old config and baseboard files have been
     removed.  If you need to resurrect these, you can get them from
     version 1.5.3.  If you can show that a board is still in use, it
     can be put back in the distribution.

  3. The '--status' command line option is now the default.  This means
     that any error in the testsuite Tcl scripts will cause runtest to
     abort with exit status code 2.  The '--status' option has been
     removed from the documentation, but will continue to be accepted
     for backward compatibility.

  4. 'runtest' now exits with exit code 0 if the testsuite "passed", 1
     if something unexpected happened (eg, FAIL, XPASS or UNRESOLVED),
     and 2 if an exception is raised by the Tcl interpreter.

  5. 'runtest' now exits with the standard exit codes of programs that
     are terminated by the SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGQUIT signals.

  6. The user-visible utility procedures 'absolute', 'psource' and
     'slay' have been removed.  If a testsuite uses any of these
     procedures, a copy of the procedure should be made and placed in
     the lib directory of the testsuite.

  7. Support was added for testing the D compiler.

  8. '~/.dejagnurc' is now loaded last, not first.  This allows the user
     to have the ability to override anything in their environment (even
     the 'site.exp' file specified by '$DEJAGNU').

  9. The user-visible utility procedure 'unsetenv' is *deprecated* and
     will be removed in the next release.  If a testsuite uses this
     procedure, a copy should be made and placed in the lib directory of
     the testsuite.

1.3 Design goals
================

DejaGnu grew out of the internal needs of Cygnus Solutions (formerly
Cygnus Support).  Cygnus maintained and enhanced a variety of free
programs in many different environments and needed a testing tool that:

   * was useful to developers while fixing bugs;

   * automated running many tests during a software release process;

   * was portable among a variety of host computers;

   * supported a cross-development environment;

   * permitted testing of interactive programs like 'GDB'; and

   * permitted testing of batch-oriented programs like 'GCC'.

   Some of the requirements proved challenging.  For example,
interactive programs do not lend themselves very well to automated
testing.  But all the requirements are important.  For instance, it is
imperative to make sure that 'GDB' works as well when cross-debugging as
it does in a native configuration.

   Probably the greatest challenge was testing in a cross-development
environment.  Most cross-development environments are customized by each
developer.  Even when buying packaged boards from vendors there are many
differences.  The communication interfaces vary from a serial line to
Ethernet.  DejaGnu was designed with a modular communication setup, so
that each kind of communication can be added as required and supported
thereafter.  Once a communication procedure is written, any test can use
it.  Currently DejaGnu can use 'ssh', 'rsh', 'rlogin', 'telnet', 'tip',
and 'kermit' for remote communications.

1.4 A POSIX compliant test framework
====================================

DejaGnu conforms to the POSIX 1003.3 standard for test frameworks.  Rob
Savoye was a member of that committee.

   POSIX standard 1003.3 defines what a testing framework needs to
provide to create a POSIX compliant testsuite.  This standard is
primarily oriented to checking POSIX conformance, but its requirements
also support testing of features not related to POSIX conformance.
POSIX 1003.3 does not specify a particular testing framework, but at
this time there is only one other POSIX conforming test framework.  TET
was created by Unisoft for a consortium comprised of X/Open, Unix
International and the Open Software Foundation.

   The POSIX documentation refers to "assertions".  An assertion is a
description of behavior.  For example, if a standard says "The sun shall
shine", a corresponding assertion might be "The sun is shining."  A test
based on this assertion would pass or fail depending on whether it is
day or night.  It is important to note that the standard being tested is
never 1003.3; the standard being tested is some other standard, for
which the assertions were written.

   As there is no testsuite to verify that testing frameworks are POSIX
1003.3 compliant, this is done by repeatedly reading the standard and
experimenting.  One of the main things POSIX 1003.3 does specify is the
set of allowed output messages and their definitions.  Four messages are
supported for a required feature of POSIX conforming systems and a fifth
for a conditional feature.  DejaGnu supports all five output messages.
In this sense a testsuite that uses exactly these messages can be
considered POSIX compliant.  These definitions specify the output of a
test case:

PASS
     A test has succeeded.  That is, it christtrated that the assertion
     is true.

FAIL
     A test has not succeeded - the assertion is false.  The _FAIL_
     message is based on this test case only.  Other messages are used
     to indicate a failure of the framework.  As with _PASS_, POSIX
     tests must return _FAIL_ rather than _XFAIL_ even if a failure was
     expected.

XFAIL
     POSIX 1003.3 does not incorporate the notion of expected failures,
     so _PASS_, instead of _XPASS_, must also be returned for test cases
     which were expected to fail and did not.  This means that _PASS_ is
     in some sense more ambiguous than if _XPASS_ is also used.

UNRESOLVED
     A test produced indeterminate results.  Usually, this means the
     test executed in an unexpected fashion.  This outcome requires a
     human to go over results to determine if the test should have
     passed or failed.  This message is also used for any test that
     requires human intervention because it is beyond the abilities of
     the testing framework.  Any unresolved test should resolved to
     _PASS_ or _FAIL_ before a test run can be considered finished.

     Note that for POSIX, each assertion must produce a test result
     code.  If the test isn't actually run, it must produce _UNRESOLVED_
     rather than just leaving that test out of the output.  This means
     that you have to be careful when writing tests to not carelessly
     use Tcl commands like _return_--if you alter the flow of control of
     the Tcl code you must insure that every test still produces some
     result code.

     Here are some of the ways a test may wind up _UNRESOLVED_:

   * Execution of a test is interrupted.

   * A test does not produce a clear result.  This is usually because
     there was an _ERROR_ from DejaGnu while processing the test, or
     because there were three or more _WARNING_ messages.  Any _WARNING_
     or _ERROR_ messages can invalidate the output of the test.  This
     usually requires a human to examine the output to determine what
     really happened - and to improve the test case.

   * A test depends on a previous test, which has failed.

   * The test was set up incorrectly.

   * A test script aborts due to a Tcl error.  In this case, the DejaGnu
     framework inserts an _UNRESOLVED_ result as a placeholder for an
     unknown number of tests that were not run because the script
     crashed.

UNTESTED
     A test was not run.  This is a placeholder used when there is no
     real test case yet.

UNSUPPORTED
     There is no support for the tested case.  This may mean that a
     conditional feature of an operating system, or of a compiler, is
     not implemented.  DejaGnu also uses this message when a testing
     environment (often a "bare board" target) lacks basic support for
     compiling or running the test case.  For example, a test for the
     system subroutine _gethostname_ would never work on a target board
     running only a boot monitor.

   DejaGnu uses the same output procedures to produce these messages for
all testsuites and these procedures are already known to conform to
POSIX 1003.3.  For a DejaGnu testsuite to conform to POSIX 1003.3, you
must avoid the _setup_xfail_ procedure as described in the _PASS_
section above and you must be careful to return _UNRESOLVED_ where
appropriate, as described in the _UNRESOLVED_ section above.

1.5 Installation
================

Refer to the 'INSTALL' in the source distribution for detailed
installation instructions.  Note that there is no compilation step as
with many other GNU packages, as DejaGnu consists of interpreted code
only.

   Save for its own small testsuite, the DejaGnu distribution does not
include any testsuites.  Testsuites for the various GNU development
tools are included with those packages.  After configuring the top-level
DejaGnu directory, unpack and configure the test directories for the
tools you want to test; then, in each test directory, run _make check_
to build auxiliary programs required by some of the tests, and run the
test suites.

2 Running tests
***************

There are two ways to execute a testsuite.  The most common way is when
there is existing support in the 'Makefile' of the tool being tested.
This usually consists of a _check_ target.  The other way is to execute
the 'runtest' program directly.  To run 'runtest' directly from the
command line requires either all of the correct command line options, or
a *note Local configuration file:: must be set up correctly.

2.1 Running 'make check'
========================

To run tests from an existing collection, first use 'configure' as usual
to set up the build directory.  Then type 'make check'.  If the _check_
target exists, it usually saves you some trouble.  For instance, it can
set up any auxiliary programs or other files needed by the tests.  The
most common file the _check_ target depends on is the 'site.exp' file.
The 'site.exp' contains various variables that DejaGnu uses to determine
the configuration of the program being tested.

   Once you have run _make check_ to build any auxiliary files, you can
invoke the test driver 'runtest' directly to repeat the tests.  You will
also have to execute 'runtest' directly for test collections with no
_check_ target in the 'Makefile'.

   GNU Automake has built-in support for DejaGnu.  To add DejaGnu
support to your generated 'Makefile.in', just add the keyword 'dejagnu'
to the AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS variable in 'Makefile.am'.  This will ensure
that the generated 'Makefile.in' has a 'check' target that invokes
DejaGnu correctly.  *Note DejaGnu Tests: (automake)Tests.

2.2 Running runtest
===================

'runtest' is the test driver for DejaGnu.  You can specify two kinds of
things on the 'runtest' command line: command line options, and Tcl
variables that are passed to the test scripts.  The options are listed
alphabetically below.

   'runtest' returns one of the following exit codes:

0
     if all tests passed including expected failures and unsupported
     tests.
1
     if any test failed, passed unexpectedly, or was unresolved.
2
     if Expect encountered any error in the test scripts.

2.2.1 Output States
-------------------

'runtest' flags the outcome of each test as one of these cases.  See
*note A POSIX Conforming Test Framework:: for a discussion of how POSIX
specifies the meanings of these cases.

PASS
     The most desirable outcome: the test was expected to succeed and
     did succeed.

XPASS
     A pleasant kind of failure: a test was expected to fail, but
     succeeded.  This may indicate progress; inspect the test case to
     determine whether you should amend it to stop expecting failure.

FAIL
     A test failed, although it was expected to succeed.  This may
     indicate regress; inspect the test case and the failing software to
     locate the bug.

XFAIL
     A test failed, but it was expected to fail.  This result indicates
     no change in a known bug.  If a test fails because the operating
     system where the test runs lacks some facility required by the
     test, the outcome is _UNSUPPORTED_ instead.

UNRESOLVED
     Output from a test requires manual inspection; the testsuite could
     not automatically determine the outcome.  For example, your tests
     can report this outcome is when a test does not complete as
     expected.

UNTESTED
     A test case is not yet complete, and in particular cannot yet
     produce a _PASS_ or _FAIL_. You can also use this outcome in dummy
     "tests" that note explicitly the absence of a real test case for a
     particular property.

UNSUPPORTED
     A test depends on a conditionally available feature that does not
     exist (in the configured testing environment).  For example, you
     can use this outcome to report on a test case that does not work on
     a particular target because its operating system support does not
     include a required subroutine.

   'runtest' may also display the following messages:

ERROR
     Indicates a major problem (detected by the test case itself) in
     running the test.  This is usually an unrecoverable error, such as
     a missing file or loss of communication to the target.  POSIX
     testsuites should not emit this message; use _UNSUPPORTED_,
     _UNTESTED_, or _UNRESOLVED_ instead, as appropriate.

WARNING
     Indicates a possible problem in running the test.  Usually warnings
     correspond to recoverable errors, or display an important message
     about the following tests.

NOTE
     An informational message about the test case.

2.2.2 Invoking runtest
----------------------

This is the full set of command line options that 'runtest' recognizes.
Option names may be abbreviated to the shortest unique string.

'-a', '--all'
     Display all test output.  By default, _runtest_ shows only the
     output of tests that produce unexpected results; that is, tests
     with status _FAIL_ (unexpected failure), _XPASS_ (unexpected
     success), or _ERROR_ (a severe error in the test case itself).
     Specify '--all' to see output for tests with status _PASS_
     (success, as expected) _XFAIL_ (failure, as expected), or _WARNING_
     (minor error in the test case itself).

'--build [triplet]'
     _triplet_ is a system triplet of the form _cpu-manufacturer-os_.
     This is the type of machine DejaGnu and the tools to be tested are
     built on.  For a normal cross environment this is the same as the
     host, but for a Canadian cross, they are different.

'-D0', '-D1'
     Start the internal Tcl debugger.  The Tcl debugger supports
     breakpoints, single stepping, and other common debugging
     activities.  See the document Debugger for Tcl Applications
     (http://expect.sourceforge.net/doc/tcl-debug.ps) by Don Libes.  If
     you specify _-D1_, the _expect_ shell stops at a breakpoint as soon
     as DejaGnu invokes it.  If you specify _-D0_, DejaGnu starts as
     usual, but you can enter the debugger by sending an interrupt (e.g.
     by typing <Ctrl>-<c>).

'--debug'
     Turns on the Expect internal debugging output.  Debugging output is
     displayed as part of the _runtest_ output, and logged to a file
     called 'dbg.log'.  The extra debugging output does _not_ appear on
     standard output, unless the verbose level is greater than 2 (for
     instance, to see debug output immediately, specify '--debug -v
     -v').  The debugging output shows all attempts at matching the test
     output of the tool with the scripted patterns describing expected
     output.  The output generated with '--strace' also goes into
     'dbg.log'.

'--global_init [name]'
     Use _name_ as the global init file instead of 'site.exp' in
     _libdir_.  The default is, of course, 'site.exp'.  Note that this
     option accepts a relative file name, interpreted starting at
     _libdir_, so a file in a subdirectory may be used.  This is
     probably less useful for most sites, but is orthogonal with the
     '--local_init' option and may be useful in large testing labs.

'--help'
     Prints out a short summary of the _runtest_ options, then exits
     (even if you specify other options).

'--host [triplet]'
     _triplet_ is a system triplet of the form _cpu-manufactuer-os_.
     Use this option to override the default string recorded by your
     configuration's choice of host.  This choice does not change how
     anything is actually configured unless -build is also specified; it
     affects _only_ DejaGnu procedures that compare the host string with
     particular values.  The procedures _ishost_, _istarget_,
     _isnative_, and _setup_xfail_ are affected by '--host'.  In this
     usage, _host_ refers to the machine that the tests are to be run
     on, which may not be the same as the _build_ machine.  If '--build'
     is also specified, then '--host' refers to the machine that the
     tests will be run on, not the machine DejaGnu is run on.

'--host_board [name]'
     The host board to use.

'--ignore [tests(s)] '
     The name(s) of specific tests to ignore.

'--local_init [name]'
     Use _name_ as the testsuite local init file instead of 'site.exp'
     in the current directory and in _objdir_.  The default is, of
     course, 'site.exp'.  Note that this option accepts a relative file
     name, so a file in a subdirectory may be used.

'--log_dialog'
     Emit Expect output to stdout.  The Expect output is usually only
     written to the '.log' file.  By enabling this option, they are also
     printed to standard output.

'--mail [address(es)]'
     Send test results to one or more email addresses.

'--objdir [path]'
     Use _path_ as the top directory containing any auxiliary compiled
     test code.  The default is '.'.  Use this option to locate
     pre-compiled test code.  You can normally prepare any auxiliary
     files needed with _make_.

'--outdir [path]'
     Write log files in directory 'path'.  The default is '.', the
     directory where you start _runtest_.  This option affects only the
     summary ('.sum') and the detailed log files ('.log').  The DejaGnu
     debug log 'dbg.log' always appears (when requested) in the local
     directory.

'--reboot [name]'
     Reboot the target board when 'runtest' starts.  When running tests
     on a separate target board, it is safer to reboot the target to be
     certain of its state.  However, when developing test scripts,
     rebooting can take a lot of time.

'--srcdir [path]'
     Use 'path' as the top directory for test scripts to run.  _runtest_
     looks in this directory for any subdirectory whose name begins with
     the toolname (specified with '--tool').  For instance, with '--tool
     gdb', _runtest_ uses tests in subdirectories 'gdb.*' (with the
     usual shell-like filename expansion).  If you do not use
     '--srcdir', _runtest_ looks for test directories under the current
     working directory.

'--strace [n]'
     Turn on internal tracing for _expect_, to n levels deep.  By
     adjusting the level, you can control the extent to which your
     output expands multi-level Tcl statements.  This allows you to
     ignore some levels of _case_ or _if_ statements.  Each procedure
     call or control structure counts as one "level".  The output is
     recorded in the same file, 'dbg.log', used for output from
     '--debug'.

'--target [triplet]'
     Use this option to override the default setting (native testing).
     _triplet_ is a system triplet of the form _cpu-manufacturer-os_.
     This option changes the configuration 'runtest' uses for the
     default tool names, and other setup information.

'--target_board [name(s)]'
     The list of target boards to run tests on.

'--tool [name(s)]'
     Specifies which testsuite to run, and what initialization module to
     use.  '--tool' is used _only_ for these two purposes.  It is _not_
     used to name the executable program to test.  Executable tool names
     (and paths) are recorded in 'site.exp' and you can override them by
     specifying Tcl variables on the command line.

     For example, including '--tool' gcc on the command line runs tests
     from all test subdirectories whose names match 'gcc.*', and uses
     one of the initialization modules named 'config/*-gcc.exp'.  To
     specify the name of the compiler (perhaps as an alternative path to
     what _runtest_ would use by default), use _GCC=path-to-gcc_ on the
     _runtest_ command line.

'--tool_exec [name]'
     The path to the tool executable to test.

'--tool_opts [options]'
     A list of additional options to pass to the tool.

'-v', '--verbose'
     Turns on more output.  Repeating this option increases the amount
     of output displayed.  Level one (_-v_) is simply test output.
     Level two (_-v -v_) shows messages on options, configuration, and
     process control.  Verbose messages appear in the detailed ('*.log')
     log file, but not in the summary ('*.sum') log file.

'-V', '--version'
     Prints out the version numbers of DejaGnu, Expect, and Tcl.

'-x', '--xml'
     Generate XML output.  The output file is named after the tool with
     an .xml extension.

'testfile'.exp[=arg(s)]
     Specify the names of testsuites to run.  By default, _runtest_ runs
     all tests for the tool, but you can restrict it to particular
     testsuites by giving the names of the _.exp_ scripts that control
     them.  _testsuite_.exp cannot include directory names, only plain
     filenames.

     'arg(s)' specifies a subset of test cases to run.  For compiler or
     assembler tests, which often use a single _.exp_ script covering
     many different test case files, this option allows you to further
     restrict the tests by listing particular test cases.  For larger
     testsuites such as that included in GCC, this can save a lot of
     time.  Some tools support wildcards here, but this varies from tool
     to tool.  Typically the wildcards _?_, _*_, and _[chars]_ are
     recognized.

'tclvar'=value
     You can define Tcl variables for use by your test scripts in the
     same style used with _make_ for environment variables.  For
     example, _runtest GDB=gdb.old_ defines a variable called 'GDB';
     when your scripts refer to '$GDB' in this run, they use the value
     _gdb.old_.

     The default Tcl variables used for most tools are defined in the
     main DejaGnu _Makefile_; their values are captured in the
     'site.exp' file.

2.2.3 Common Options
--------------------

Typically, you don't need to use any command line options.  The '--tool'
option is only required when there is more than one testsuite in the
same directory.  The default options are in the local 'site.exp' file,
created by 'make site.exp'.

   For example, if the directory 'gdb/testsuite' contains a collection
of DejaGnu tests for GDB, you can run them like this:

     $ cd gdb/testsuite
     $ runtest --tool gdb

   The test output follows, then ends with:

     === gdb Summary ===

     # of expected passes 508
     # of expected failures 103
     /usr/latest/bin/gdb version 4.14.4 -nx

   You can use the option '--srcdir' to point to some other directory
containing a collection of tests:

     $ runtest --srcdir /devo/gdb/testsuite

   By default, 'runtest' prints only the names of the tests it runs,
output from any tests that have unexpected results, and a summary
showing how many tests passed and how many failed.  To display output
from all tests (whether or not they behave as expected), use the '-a'
(all) option.  For more verbose output about processes being run,
communication, and so on, use '-v' (verbose).  To see even more output,
use multiple '-v' options.  See *note Invoking runtest:: for a more
detailed explanation of each 'runtest' option.

2.3 Output files
================

DejaGnu always writes two kinds of output files.  Summary output is
written to the '.sum' file, and detailed output is written to the '.log'
file.  The tool name determines the prefix for these files.  For
example, after running with '--tool gdb', the output files will be
called 'gdb.sum' and 'gdb.log'.  For troubleshooting, a debug log file
that logs the operation of Expect is available.  Each of these will be
described in turn.

2.3.1 Summary log file
----------------------

DejaGnu always produces a summary ('.sum') output file.  This summary
lists the names of all test files run.  For each test file, one line of
output from each 'pass' command (showing status _PASS_ or _XPASS_) or
'fail' command (status _FAIL_ or _XFAIL_), trailing summary statistics
that count passing and failing tests (expected and unexpected), the full
pathname of the tool tested, and the version number of the tool.  All
possible outcomes, and all errors, are always reflected in the summary
output file, regardless of whether or not you specify '--all'.

   If any of your tests use the procedures 'unresolved', 'unsupported',
or 'untested', the summary output also tabulates the corresponding
outcomes.

   For example, after running 'runtest --tool binutils' a summary log
file will be written to 'binutils.sum'.  Normally, DejaGnu writes this
file in your current working directory.  Use the '--outdir' option to
select a different output directory.

   *Sample summary log*

     # of unexpected failures        1
     /usr/latest/bin/gdb version 4.6.5 -q


2.3.2 Detailed log file
-----------------------

DejaGnu also saves a detailed log file ('.log'), showing any output
generated by test cases as well as the summary output.  For example,
after running 'runtest --tool binutils', a detailed log file will be
written to 'binutils.log'.  Normally, DejaGnu writes this file in your
current working directory.  Use the '--outdir' option to select a
different output directory.

     /usr/latest/bin/g++ version cygnus-2.0.1


2.3.3 Debug log file
--------------------

The 'runtest' option '--debug' creates a file showing the output from
Expect in debugging mode.  The 'dbg.log' file is created in the current
directory.  The log file shows the string sent to the tool being tested
by each 'send' command and the pattern it compares with the tool output
by each 'expect' command.

   The log messages begin with a message of the form:

     expect: does {tool output} (spawn_id n)
        match pattern {expected pattern}?

   For every unsuccessful match, Expect issues a _no_ after this
message.  If other patterns are specified for the same Expect command,
they are reflected also, but without the first part of the message
(_expect...  match pattern_).

   When Expect finds a match, the log for the successful match ends with
_yes_, followed by a record of the Expect variables set to describe a
successful match.

   *Example debug log file for a GDB test*

     send: sent {break gdbme.c:34\n} to spawn id 6
     expect: does {} (spawn_id 6) match pattern {Breakpoint.*at.* file
     gdbme.c, line 34.*\(gdb\) $}? no
     {.*\(gdb\) $}? no
     expect: does {} (spawn_id 0) match pattern {return} ? no
     {\(y or n\) }? no
     {buffer_full}? no
     {virtual}? no
     {memory}? no
     {exhausted}? no
     {Undefined}? no
     {command}? no
     break gdbme.c:34
     Breakpoint 8 at 0x23d8: file gdbme.c, line 34.
     (gdb) expect: does {break gdbme.c:34\r\nBreakpoint 8 at 0x23d8:
     file gdbme.c, line 34.\r\n(gdb) } (spawn_id 6) match pattern
     {Breakpoint.*at.* file gdbme.c, line 34.*\(gdb\) $}? yes
     expect: set expect_out(0,start) {18}
     expect: set expect_out(0,end) {71}
     expect: set expect_out(0,string) {Breakpoint 8 at 0x23d8: file
     gdbme.c, line 34.\r\n(gdb) }
     epect: set expect_out(spawn_id) {6}
     expect: set expect_out(buffer) {break gdbme.c:34\r\nBreakpoint 8
     at 0x23d8: file gdbme.c, line 34.\r\n(gdb) }
     PASS:   70      0       breakpoint line number in file


   This example exhibits three properties of Expect and DejaGnu that
might be surprising at first glance:

   * Empty output for the first attempted match.  The first set of
     attempted matches shown ran against the output _{}_ -- that is, no
     output.  Expect begins attempting to match the patterns supplied
     immediately; often, the first pass is against incomplete output (or
     completely before all output, as in this case).

   * Interspersed tool output.  The beginning of the log entry for the
     second attempted match may be hard to spot: this is because the
     prompt _{(gdb) }_ appears on the same line, just before the
     _expect:_ that marks the beginning of the log entry.

   * Fail-safe patterns.  Many of the patterns tested are fail-safe
     patterns provided by GDB testing utilities, to reduce possible
     indeterminacy.  It is useful to anticipate potential variations
     caused by extreme system conditions (GDB might issue the message
     _virtual memory exhausted_ in rare circumstances), or by changes in
     the tested program (_Undefined command_ is the likeliest outcome if
     the name of a tested command changes).

     The pattern _{return}_ is a particularly interesting fail-safe to
     notice; it checks for an unexpected <RET> prompt.  This may happen,
     for example, if the tested tool can filter output through a pager.

     These fail-safe patterns (like the debugging log itself) are
     primarily useful while developing test scripts.  Use the 'error'
     procedure to make the actions for fail-safe patterns produce
     messages starting with _ERROR_ on standard output, and in the
     detailed log file.

3 Running other DejaGnu commands
********************************

DejaGnu now features auxiliary commands not directly related to running
tests, but somehow related to the broader purpose of testing.

   These commands are run via the 'dejagnu' multiplex launcher, which
locates an appropriate script and the required interpreter and then runs
the requested command.

3.1 Invoking 'dejagnu'
======================

The 'dejagnu' launcher is primarily designed to pass most options on to
the scripts that it runs, but does process the '--help' and '--version'
options entirely internally, while also recognizing the '--verbose'
option.

     dejagnu <command> [options...]
     dejagnu --help
     dejagnu --version

   Note that the command names may contain multiple words.  In this
case, the command can be given as separate arguments to 'dejagnu' or
combined with dashes ('-'); both forms are equivalent.

   All words of the command name must appear before any options.  The
search for a command terminates when an option is found.

   Note that the first valid command found is used.  A longer command
name can be shadowed by a shorter command name that happens to be a
prefix of the longer name, if the command name is given as multiple
arguments.  The equivalent form with the longer command name combined
using dashes into a single argument will correctly refer to the
otherwise shadowed command.

   The 'dejagnu' launcher can also be run using symbolic links, provided
that the shell places the name under which 'dejagnu' was invoked in
'$0'.  Any dash-separated words after "dejagnu" in the name of such a
link are taken to be the leading words of a command name.

   The 'dejagnu' launcher supports alternate implementations depending
upon available interpreters.

   Options for the 'dejagnu' launcher itself cannot be abbreviated,
since the launcher has no way to know which abbreviations are unique and
which would be ambiguous to the invoked command.

'--help'
     Print a help message instead of running a command.

'-V', '--version'
     Print a version banner for the launcher itself including the
     version of DejaGnu.  Any command given is ignored.

'-v', '--verbose'
     Emit additional output describing the inner workings of the
     'dejagnu' launcher.  This option is also passed on to the invoked
     command.

   All arguments after the command name are passed to the invoked
command.

3.2 Invoking 'dejagnu help'
===========================

The 'dejagnu help' tool displays long-form documentation for DejaGnu
auxiliary commands that are invoked using the 'dejagnu' launcher.

     dejagnu help [options...] <command>

   Again, command names may contain multiple words.  This command forms
an operand by joining all words in the command name using dashes ('-')
and prepending 'dejagnu-'.  This is then used as the name of a manual
page and passed to the 'man' command.

   If the manual page is in a particular directory relative to the
script implementing this command, a full file name is produced,
otherwise, 'man' performs its normal search.

   The '--verbose' option causes additional output describing the inner
workings of the 'dejagnu help' command to be produced.

   The '--path', '-w', and '-W' options are passed to 'man'.

3.3 Invoking 'dejagnu report card'
==================================

The 'dejagnu report card' tool produces a tabular summary of the results
from test runs by reading the summary files that DejaGnu produces.

     dejagnu report card [<option>|<tool>|<file>]...

   The '--verbose' option causes additional output describing the inner
workings of the 'dejagnu report card' command to be produced.

   Aside from options, the command may include a list of tools or files.
Names ending in '.sum' are used as-is.  Names ending in '.log' are
changed to instead refer to the summary file.  Names ending with a
simple dot ('.') have 'sum' appended, for convenience when using
Readline filename completion in a shell, which will complete to the dot,
since there are both '.sum' and '.log' files produced for each tool
tested.  Lastly, all other names are taken as tool names and '.sum' is
appended to refer to the summary file produced by DejaGnu.

   The relevant summary files are read and an ASCII-art table is
produced.  The table has columns for counts of tests passed, failed,
unsupported, unresolved, and untested.  Tests that are expected to pass
and tests that are expected to fail are counted in separate columns, but
known failures ('KFAIL' and 'KPASS') are summarized together with
expected failures ('XFAIL' and 'XPASS') in two additional columns:
'?PASS' and '?FAIL'.  Additionally, if a test produced any warnings or
errors, tags '!W!' or '!E!' are added at the end of the row.

4 Customizing DejaGnu
*********************

The site configuration file, 'site.exp', captures
configuration-dependent values and propagates them to the DejaGnu test
environment using Tcl variables.  This ties the DejaGnu test scripts
into the 'configure' and 'make' programs.  If this file is setup
correctly, it is possible to execute a testsuite merely by typing
'runtest'.

   DejaGnu supports two 'site.exp' files.  The multiple instances of
'site.exp' are loaded in a fixed order.  The first file loaded is the
local file 'site.exp', and then the optional global 'site.exp' file as
pointed to by the 'DEJAGNU' environment variable.

   There is an optional global 'site.exp', containing configuration
values that apply to DejaGnu site-wide.  'runtest' loads these values
first.  The global 'site.exp' contains the default values for all
targets and hosts supported by DejaGnu.  This global file is identified
by setting the environment variable 'DEJAGNU' to the name of the file.
If 'DEJAGNU' is set, but the file cannot be located, an error will be
raised and 'runtest' will abort.

   Any directory containing a configured testsuite also has a local
'site.exp', capturing configuration values specific to the tool being
tested.  Since 'runtest' loads these values last, the individual test
configuration can either rely on and use, or override, any of the global
values from the global 'site.exp' file.

   You can usually generate or update the testsuite's local 'site.exp'
by typing 'make site.exp' in the testsuite directory, after the test
suite is configured.

   You can also have a file in your home directory called '.dejagnurc'.
This gets loaded after the other config files.  Usually this is used for
personal stuff, like setting the 'all_flag' so all the output gets
printed, or your own verbosity levels.  This file is usually restricted
to setting command line options.

   You can further override the default values in a user-editable
section of any 'site.exp', or by setting variables on the 'runtest'
command line.

4.1 Global configuration file
=============================

The global configuration file is where all the target specific
configuration variables for a site are set.  For example, a centralized
testing lab where multiple developers have to share an embedded
development board.  There are settings for both remote hosts and remote
targets.  Below is an example of a global configuration file for a
Canadian cross environment.  A Canadian cross is a toolchain that is
built on, runs on, and targets three different system triplets (for
example, building a Solaris-hosted MIPS R4000 toolchain on a GNU/Linux
system).  This example is based on a configuration once used at Cygnus.

   *Example global configuration file*

     # Make sure we look in the right place for the board description files.
     lappend boards_dir "/nfs/cygint/s1/cygnus/dejagnu/boards"

     verbose "Global config file: target_triplet is $target_triplet" 2
     global target_list

     switch -glob -- $target_triplet {
         "native" {
             set target_list "unix"
         }
         "sparc64-*elf" {
             set target_list "sparc64-sim"
         }
         "mips-*elf" {
             set target_list "mips-sim wilma barney"
         }
         "mips-lsi-elf" {
             set target_list "mips-lsi-sim{,soft-float,el}"
         }
     }

   In this case, we have support for several cross compilers, that all
run on this host.  To run DejaGnu tests on tools hosted on operating
systems that do not run Expect, DejaGnu can be run on the build machine
and connect to the remote host to run all the tests.  As you can see,
all one does is set the variable 'target_list' to the list of targets
and options to test.

   In this example, simple cases like _sparc64-elf_ only require setting
the name of the single board configuration file.  The _mips-elf_ target
is more complicated and sets the list to three target boards.
_mips-sim_ is a symbolic name for a simulator "board" and _wilma_ and
_barney_ are symbolic names for physical boards.  Symbolic names are
covered in the *note Adding a new board:: section.  The more complicated
example is the entry for _mips-lsi-elf_.  This one runs the tests with
multiple iterations using all possible combinations of the
'--soft-float' and the '--el' (little endian) options.  The braced
string includes an initial comma so that the set of combinations
includes no options at all.  Needless to say, this last target example
is mostly specific to compiler testing.

4.2 Local configuration file
============================

It is usually more convenient to keep these _manual overrides_ in the
'site.exp' local to each test directory, rather than in the global
'site.exp' in the installed DejaGnu library.  This file is mostly for
supplying tool specific info that is required by the testsuite.

   All local 'site.exp' files have two sections, separated by comments.
The first section is generated by 'make'.  It is essentially a
collection of Tcl variable definitions based on 'Makefile' environment
variables.  Since they are generated by 'make', they contain the values
as specified by 'configure'.  In particular, this section contains the
'Makefile' variables for host and target configuration data.  Do not
edit this first section; if you do, your changes will be overwritten the
next time you run 'make'.  The first section starts with:

     ## these variables are automatically generated by make ##
     # Do not edit here. If you wish to override these values
     # add them to the last section

   In the second section, you can override any default values for all
the variables.  The second section can also contain your preferred
defaults for all the command line options to 'runtest'.  This allows you
to easily customize 'runtest' for your preferences in each configured
testsuite tree, so that you need not type options repeatedly on the
command line.  The second section may also be empty if you do not wish
to override any defaults.

   *The first section ends with this line*

     ## All variables above are generated by configure. Do Not Edit ##

   You can make any changes under this line.  If you wish to redefine a
variable in the top section, then just put a duplicate value in this
second section.  Usually the values defined in this configuration file
are related to the configuration of the test run.  This is the ideal
place to set the variables 'host_triplet', 'build_triplet',
'target_triplet'.  All other variables are tool dependent, i.e., for
testing a compiler, the value for 'CC' might be set to a freshly built
binary, as opposed to one in the user's path.

   Here's an example local site.exp file, as used for GCC/G++ testing.

   *Local Configuration File*

     ## these variables are automatically generated by make ##
     # Do not edit here. If you wish to override these values
     # add them to the last section
     set rootme "/build/devo-builds/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc"
     set host_triplet i686-pc-linux-gnu
     set build_triplet i686-pc-linux-gnu
     set target_triplet i686-pc-linux-gnu
     set target_alias i686-pc-linux-gnu
     set CFLAGS ""
     set CXXFLAGS "-isystem /build/devo-builds/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc/../libio -isystem $srcdir/../libg++/src -isystem $srcdir/../libio -isystem $srcdir/../libstdc++ -isystem $srcdir/../libstdc++/stl -L/build/devo-builds/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc/../libg++ -L/build/devo-builds/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc/../libstdc++"
     append LDFLAGS " -L/build/devo-builds/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc/../ld"
     set tmpdir /build/devo-builds/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc/testsuite
     set srcdir "${srcdir}/testsuite"
     ## All variables above are generated by configure. Do Not Edit ##

   This file defines the required fields for a local configuration file,
namely the three system triplets, and the srcdir.  It also defines
several other Tcl variables that are used exclusively by the GCC
testsuite.  For most test cases, the CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS are supplied
by DejaGnu itself for cross testing, but to test a compiler, GCC needs
to manipulate these itself.

   The local 'site.exp' may also set Tcl variables such as
'test_timeout' which can control the amount of time (in seconds) to wait
for a remote test to complete.  If not specified, 'test_timeout'
defaults to 300 seconds.

4.3 Board configuration file
============================

The board configuration file is where board-specific configuration
details are stored.  A board configuration file contains all the
higher-level configuration settings.  There is a rough inheritance
scheme, where it is possible to derive a new board description file from
an existing one.  There are also collections of custom procedures for
common environments.  For more information on adding a new board config
file, see *note Adding a new board::.

   An example board configuration file for a GNU simulator is as
follows.  'set_board_info' is a procedure that sets the field name to
the specified value.  The procedures mentioned in brackets are _helper
procedures_.  These are used to find parts of a toolchain required to
build an executable image that may reside in various locations.  This is
mostly of use when the startup code, the standard C libraries, or the
toolchain itself is part of your build tree.

   *Example file*
     # This is a list of toolchains that are supported on this board.
     set_board_info target_install {sparc64-elf}

     # Load the generic configuration for this board. This will define any
     # routines needed by the tool to communicate with the board.
     load_generic_config "sim"

     # We need this for find_gcc and *_include_flags/*_link_flags.
     load_base_board_description "basic-sim"

     # Use long64 by default.
     process_multilib_options "long64"

     setup_sim sparc64

     # We only support newlib on this target. We assume that all multilib
     # options have been specified before we get here.

     set_board_info compiler "[find_gcc]"
     set_board_info cflags "[libgloss_include_flags] [newlib_include_flags]"
     set_board_info ldflags "[libgloss_link_flags] [newlib_link_flags]"
     # No linker script.
     set_board_info ldscript ""

     # Used by a few gcc.c-torture testcases to delimit how large the
     # stack can be.
     set_board_info gcc,stack_size 16384
     # The simulator doesn't return exit status and we need to indicate this
     # the standard GCC wrapper will work with this target.
     set_board_info needs_status_wrapper 1
     # We can't pass arguments to programs.
     set_board_info noargs 1

   There are five helper procedures used in this example:

   * 'find_gcc' looks for a copy of the GNU compiler in your build tree,
     or it uses the one in your path.  This will also return the proper
     transformed name for a cross compiler if you whole build tree is
     configured for one.  DejaGnu will use this procedure to locate a
     compiler if the 'compiler' field is not set.

   * 'libgloss_include_flags' returns the flags to compile using *note
     libgloss: Libgloss, the GNU board support package (BSP).

   * 'libgloss_link_flags' returns the flags to link an executable using
     *note libgloss: Libgloss.

   * 'newlib_include_flags' returns the flags to compile using newlib
     (https://sourceware.org/newlib), a re-entrant standard C library
     for embedded systems comprising of non-GPL'd code

   * 'newlib_link_flags' returns the flags to link an executable with
     newlib (https://sourceware.org/newlib).

4.4 Remote host testing
=======================

DejaGnu also supports running the tests on a remote host.  To set this
up, the remote host needs an FTP server, and a telnet server.  Currently
foreign operating systems used as remote hosts are VxWorks, VRTX,
DOS/Windows 3.1, MacOS and Windows.

   The recommended source for a Windows-based FTP server is to get IIS
(either IIS 1 or Personal Web Server) from http://www.microsoft.com
(http://www.microsoft.com).  When you install it, make sure you install
the FTP server - it's not selected by default.  Go into the IIS manager
and change the FTP server so that it does not allow anonymous FTP. Set
the home directory to the root directory (i.e.  c:\) of a suitable
drive.  Allow writing via FTP.

   It will create an account like IUSR_FOOBAR where foobar is the name
of your machine.  Go into the user editor and give that account a
password that you don't mind hanging around in the clear (i.e.  not the
same as your admin or personal passwords).  Also, add it to all the
various permission groups.

   You'll also need a telnet server.  For Windows, go to the Ataman
(http://ataman.com) web site, pick up the Ataman Remote Logon Services
for Windows, and install it.  You can get started on the eval period
anyway.  Add IUSR_FOOBAR to the list of allowed users, set the HOME
directory to be the same as the FTP default directory.  Change the Mode
prompt to simple.

   Now you need to pick a directory name to do all the testing in.  For
the sake of this example, we'll call it piggy (i.e.  c:\piggy).  Create
this directory.

   You'll need a Unix machine.  Create a directory for the scripts
you'll need.  For this example, we'll use /usr/local/swamp/testing.
You'll need to have a source tree somewhere, say /usr/src/devo.  Now,
copy some files from releng's area in SV to your machine:

   *Remote host setup*

     cd /usr/local/swamp/testing
     mkdir boards
     scp darkstar.welcomehome.org:/dejagnu/cst/bin/MkTestDir .
     scp darkstar.welcomehome.org:/dejagnu/site.exp .
     scp darkstar.welcomehome.org:/dejagnu/boards/useless98r2.exp boards/foobar.exp
     export DEJAGNU=/usr/local/swamp/testing/site.exp

   You must edit the boards/foobar.exp file to reflect your machine;
change the hostname (foobar.com), username (iusr_foobar), password, and
ftp_directory (c:/piggy) to match what you selected.

   Edit the global ' site.exp' to reflect your boards directory:

   *Add The Board Directory*

     lappend boards_dir "/usr/local/swamp/testing/boards"

   Now run MkTestDir, which is in the contrib directory.  The first
parameter is the toolchain prefix, the second is the location of your
devo tree.  If you are testing a cross compiler (ex: you have
sh-hms-gcc.exe in your PATH on the PC), do something like this:

   *Setup Cross Remote Testing*

     ./MkTestDir sh-hms /usr/dejagnu/src/devo

   If you are testing a native PC compiler (ex: you have gcc.exe in your
PATH on the PC), do this:

   *Setup Native Remote Testing*

     ./MkTestDir '' /usr/dejagnu/src/devo

   To test the setup, 'ftp' to your PC using the username (iusr_foobar)
and password you selected.  CD to the test directory.  Upload a file to
the PC. Now telnet to your PC using the same username and password.  CD
to the test directory.  Make sure the file is there.  Type "set" and/or
"gcc -v" (or sh-hms-gcc -v) and make sure the default PATH contains the
installation you want to test.

   *Run Test Remotely*

     cd /usr/local/swamp/testing
     make  -k -w check RUNTESTFLAGS="--host_board foobar --target_board foobar -v -v" > check.out 2>&1

   To run a specific test, use a command like this (for this example,
you'd run this from the gcc directory that MkTestDir created):

   *Run a Test Remotely*

     make check RUNTESTFLAGS="--host_board sloth --target_board sloth -v compile.exp=921202-1.c"

   Note: if you are testing a cross-compiler, put in the correct target
board.  You'll also have to download more .exp files and modify them for
your local configuration.  The -v's are optional.

4.5 Configuration file values
=============================

DejaGnu uses a Tcl associative array to hold all the info for each
machine.  In the case of a Canadian cross, this means host information
as well as target information.  The named array is called 'target_info',
and it has two indices.  The following fields are part of the array.

4.5.1 Command line option variables
-----------------------------------

In the user editable second section of the *note User configuration
file:: you can not only override the configuration variables captured in
the first section, but also specify default values for all of the
'runtest' command line options.  Excepting '--debug', '--help', and
'--version', each command line option has an associated Tcl variable.
Use the Tcl 'set' command to specify a new default value (as for the
configuration variables).  The following table describes the
correspondence between command line options and variables you can set in
'site.exp'.  Refer to *note Invoking runtest::, for explanations of the
command-line options.

Option          Tcl variable      Description

-local_init     local_init_file   file name for local init file in 'objdir'

-objdir         objdir            directory for pre-compiled binaries
                                  
-reboot         reboot            reboot the target if set to 1
                                  
-srcdir         srcdir            directory of test subdirectories
                                  
-target         target_triplet    system triplet for the target

                                  run)
                                  
-tool_exec      TOOL_EXECUTABLE   path to the executable to test
                                  
-tool_opts      TOOL_OPTIONS      additional options to pass to the tool
                                  
-tool_root_dir  tool_root_dir     tool root directory

4.5.2 Per-user configuration file (.dejagnurc)
----------------------------------------------

The per-user configuration file is named '.dejagnurc' in the user's home
directory.  It is used to customize the behaviour of 'runtest' for each
user - typically the user's preference for log verbosity, and for
storing any experimental Tcl procedures.  An example '~/.dejagnurc' file
looks like:

   *Example .dejagnurc*

     set all_flag 1
     set RLOGIN /usr/ucb/rlogin
     set RSH /usr/local/sbin/ssh

   Here 'all_flag' is set so that I see all the test cases that PASS
along with the ones that FAIL. I also set 'RLOGIN' to the BSD
(non-Kerberos) version.  I also set 'RSH' to the SSH secure shell, as
rsh is mostly used to test Unix machines within a local network.

5 Extending DejaGnu
*******************

This chapter describes how to extend DejaGnu with new testsuites, new
tools, new targets and new boards.

5.1 Adding a new testsuite
==========================

The testsuite for a new package should always be located in the source
directory of that package.  DejaGnu requires this directory to be named
'testsuite'.  Under this directory, the test cases go in various
subdirectories whose name begins with the tool name.  The organization
of the various testsuite subdirectories is up to you.  For a tool named
'gdb', for instance, each subdirectory containing tests must start with
'gdb.'.

5.2 Adding a new tool
=====================

In general, the best way to learn how to write code, or even prose, is
to read something similar.  This principle applies to test cases and to
testsuites.  Unfortunately, well-established testsuites have a way of
developing their own conventions: as test writers become more
experienced with DejaGnu and with Tcl, they accumulate more utilities,
and take advantage of more and more features of Expect and Tcl in
general.  Inspecting such established testsuites may make the prospect
of creating an entirely new testsuite appear overwhelming.
Nevertheless, it is straightforward to start a new testsuite.

   To help orient you further in this task, here is an outline of the
steps to begin building a testsuite for a program example.

   Create or select a directory to contain your new collection of tests.
Change into that directory (shown here as 'testsuite'):

   Create a 'configure.in' file in this directory, to control
configuration-dependent choices for your tests.  So far as DejaGnu is
concerned, the important thing is to set a value for the variable
'target_abbrev'; this value is the link to the init file you will write
soon.  (For simplicity, we assume the environment is Unix, and use
_unix_ as the value.)

   What else is needed in 'configure.in' depends on the requirements of
your tool, your intended test environments, and which configure system
you use.  This example is a minimal 'configure.ac' for use with GNU
Autoconf.

5.2.1 Sample Makefile.in Fragment
---------------------------------

Create 'Makefile.in' (if using Autoconf), or 'Makefile.am' (if using
Automake), the source file used by configure to build your 'Makefile'.
If you are using GNU Automake.just add the keyword _dejagnu_ to the
_AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS_ variable in your 'Makefile.am' file.  This will add
all the 'Makefile' support needed to run DejaGnu, and support the *note
make check: Make Check. target.

   You also need to include two targets important to DejaGnu: _check_,
to run the tests, and _site.exp_, to set up the Tcl copies of
configuration-dependent values.  This is called the *note Local
configuration file:: The _check_ target must invoke the 'runtest'
program to run the tests.

   The _site.exp_ target should usually set up (among other things) the
_$tool_ variable for the name of your program.  If the local 'site.exp'
file is setup correctly, it is possible to execute the tests by merely
typing 'runtest' on the command line.

     # Look for a local version of DejaGnu, otherwise use one in the path
     RUNTEST = `if test -f $(top_srcdir)/../dejagnu/runtest; then \
           echo $(top_srcdir) ../dejagnu/runtest; \
         else \
           echo runtest; \
         fi`

     # Flags to pass to runtest
     RUNTESTFLAGS =

     # Execute the tests
     check: site.exp all
             $(RUNTEST) $(RUNTESTFLAGS) --tool ${example} --srcdir $(srcdir)

     # Make the local config file
     site.exp: ./config.status Makefile
             @echo "Making a new config file..."
             -@rm -f ./tmp?
             @touch site.exp

             -@mv site.exp site.bak
             @echo "## these variables are automatically generated by make ##" > ./tmp0
             @echo "# Do not edit here. If you wish to override these values" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "# add them to the last section" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set host_os ${host_os}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set host_alias ${host_alias}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set host_cpu ${host_cpu}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set host_vendor ${host_vendor}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set target_os ${target_os}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set target_alias ${target_alias}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set target_cpu ${target_cpu}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set target_vendor ${target_vendor}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set host_triplet ${host_canonical}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set target_triplet ${target_canonical}">>./tmp0
             @echo "set tool binutils" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set srcdir ${srcdir}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set objdir `pwd`" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "set ${examplename} ${example}" >> ./tmp0
             @echo "## All variables above are generated by configure. Do Not Edit ##" >> ./tmp0
             @cat ./tmp0 > site.exp
             @sed < site.bak \
                 -e '1,/^## All variables above are.*##/ d' \
                 >> site.exp
             -@rm -f ./tmp?

5.2.2 Simple tool init file for batch programs
----------------------------------------------

The tool init file may be placed in 'testsuite/lib' or in
'testsuite/lib/tool' and must be named 'TOOL.exp', where TOOL is the
name of the tool to be tested.  For this example, we will use the name
'example' for the tool name, which means that the tool init file must be
named 'example.exp'.  If the program being tested is not interactive,
you can get away with this minimal tool init file to begin with:

     proc example_exit {} {}
     proc example_version {} {}

   By convention, the file name for the executable for a tool should be
stored in a global variable with the same name as the tool, but in all
uppercase.  For our example program 'example', the name of the program
under test should be stored in 'EXAMPLE'.

5.2.3 Simple tool init file for interactive programs
----------------------------------------------------

If the program being tested is interactive, however, you might as well
define a _start_ routine and invoke it by using a tool init file like
this:

     proc example_exit {} {}
     proc example_version {} {}

     proc example_start {} {
          global EXAMPLE
          spawn $EXAMPLE
          expect {
             -re "" {}
          }
     }

     # Start the program running we want to test
     example_start

   Create a directory whose name begins with your tool's name, to
contain tests.  For example, if the tool name is 'example', then the
directories all need to start with 'example.'.  Create a sample test
file ending in '.exp'.  You can name the file 'first-try.exp'.  To begin
with, just write one line of Tcl code to issue a message:

     send_user "Testing: one, two...\n"

5.2.4 Testing A New Tool Config
-------------------------------

Back in the 'testsuite' (top level) directory, run 'configure'.
Typically you do this while in the build directory.  You are now ready
to type 'make check' or 'runtest'.  You should see something like this:

     Test Run By bje on Sat Nov 14 15:08:54 AEDT 2015

                     === example tests ===

     Running ./example.0/first-try.exp ...
     Testing: one, two...

                     === example Summary ===

   There is no output in the summary, because so far the example does
not call any of the procedures that report a test outcome.

   Write some real tests.  For an interactive tool, you should probably
write a real exit routine in fairly short order.  In any case, you
should also write a real version routine soon.

5.3 Adding a new target
=======================

DejaGnu has some additional requirements for target support, beyond the
general-purpose provisions of a 'configure' script.  DejaGnu must
actively communicate with the target, rather than simply generating or
managing code for the target architecture.  Therefore, each tool
requires an initialization module for each target.  For new targets, you
must supply a few Tcl procedures to adapt DejaGnu to the target.

   Usually the best way to write a new initialization module is to edit
an existing initialization module; some trial and error will be
required.  If necessary, you can use the '--debug' option to see what is
really going on.

   When you code an initialization module, be generous in printing
information using the 'verbose' procedure.  In cross-development
environments, most of the work is in getting the communications right.
Code for communicating via TCP/IP networks or serial lines is available
in a DejaGnu library files such as 'lib/telnet.exp'.

   If you suspect a communication problem, try running the connection
interactively from Expect.  (There are three ways of running Expect as
an interactive interpreter.  You can run Expect with no arguments, and
control it completely interactively; or you can use 'expect -i' together
with other command-line options and arguments; or you can run the
command 'interpreter' from any Expect procedure.  Use 'return' to get
back to the calling procedure (if any), or 'return -tcl' to make the
calling procedure itself return to its caller; use 'exit' or end-of-file
to leave Expect altogether.)  Run the program whose name is recorded in
'$connectmode', with the arguments in '$targetname', to establish a
connection.  You should at least be able to get a prompt from any target
that is physically connected.

5.4 Adding a new board
======================

Adding a new board consists of creating a new board configuration file.
Examples are in 'dejagnu/baseboards'.  Usually to make a new board file,
it's easiest to copy an existing one.  It is also possible to have your
file be based on a _baseboard_ file with only one or two changes needed.
Typically, this can be as simple as just changing the linker script.
Once the new baseboard file is done, add it to the 'boards_DATA' list in
the 'dejagnu/baseboards/Makefile.am', and regenerate the Makefile.in
using automake.  Then just rebuild and install DejaGnu.  You can test it
by:

   There is a crude inheritance scheme going on with board files, so you
can include one board file into another, The two main procedures used to
do this are 'load_generic_config' and 'load_base_board_description'.
The generic configuration file contains other procedures used for a
certain class of target.  The board description file is where the board
specific settings go.  Commonly there are similar target environments
with just different processors.

   *Testing a New Board Configuration File*

     make check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=newboardfile".

   Here's an example of a board configuration file.  There are several
_helper procedures_ used in this example.  A helper procedure is one
that look for a tool of files in commonly installed locations.  These
are mostly used when testing in the build tree, because the executables
to be tested are in the same tree as the new DejaGnu files.  The helper
procedures are the ones in brackets, which indicates a Tcl procedure
call.

   *Example Board Configuration File*

     # Load the generic configuration for this board. This will define a basic
     # set of routines needed by the tool to communicate with the board.
     load_generic_config "sim"

     # basic-sim.exp is a basic description for the standard Cygnus simulator.
     load_base_board_description "basic-sim"

     # The compiler used to build for this board. This has *nothing* to do
     # with what compiler is tested if we're testing gcc. Further, this is
     # the default, so this line is optional for most boards.
     set_board_info compiler "[find_gcc]"

     # We only support newlib on this target.
     # However, we include libgloss so we can find the linker scripts.
     set_board_info cflags "[newlib_include_flags] [libgloss_include_flags]"
     set_board_info ldflags "[newlib_link_flags]"

     # No linker script for this board.
     set_board_info ldscript "-Tsim.ld"

     # The simulator doesn't return exit statuses and we need to indicate this.
     set_board_info needs_status_wrapper 1

     # Can't pass arguments to this target.
     set_board_info noargs 1

     # No signals.
     set_board_info gdb,nosignals 1

     # And it can't call functions.
     set_board_info gdb,cannot_call_functions 1

5.5 Board configuration file values
===================================

The following fields are in the 'board_info' array.  These are set by
the 'set_board_info' procedure (or 'add_board_info' procedure for
appending to lists).  Both procedures take a field name and a value for
the field (or is added to the field), respectively.  Some common board
info fields are shown below.

*Field*        *Example       *Description*
               value*
compiler       '[find_gcc]'   The path to the compiler to use.
cflags         '-mca'         Compilation flags for the compiler.
ldflags        '[libgloss_link_flags]Linking flags for the compiler.
               [newlib_link_flags]'
ldscript       '-Wl,-Tidt.ld' The linker script to use when cross
                              compiling.

                              unreliable.
sim            [find_sim]     The path to the simulator to use.
objcopy        $tempfil       The path to the 'objcopy' program.
support_libs   '${prefix_dir}/i386-coff/'Support libraries needed for cross
                              compiling.
addl_link_flags'-N'           Additional link flags, rarely used.
remotedir      '/tmp/runtest.[pid]'Directory on the remote target in which
                              executables are downloaded and executed.

   These fields are used by the GCC and GDB tests, and are mostly only
useful to somewhat trying to debug a new board file for one of these
tools.  Many of these are used only by a few testcases, and their
purpose is esoteric.  These are listed with sample values as a guide to
better guessing if you need to change any of these.

   *Board Info Fields For GCC & GDB*

Field                    Sample Value             Description

5.6 Writing a test case
=======================

The easiest way to prepare a new test case is to base it on an existing
one for a similar situation.  There are two major categories of tests:
batch-oriented and interactive.  Batch-oriented tests are usually easier
to write.

   The GCC tests are a good example of batch-oriented tests.  All GCC
tests consist primarily of a call to a single common procedure, since
all the tests either have no output, or only have a few warning messages
when successfully compiled.  Any non-warning output constitutes a test
failure.  All the C code needed is kept in the test directory.  The test
driver, written in Tcl, need only get a listing of all the C files in
the directory, and compile them all using a generic procedure.  This
procedure and a few others supporting for these tests are kept in the
library module 'lib/c-torture.exp' of the GCC testsuite.  Most tests of
this kind use very few Expect features, and are coded almost purely in
Tcl.

   Writing the complete suite of C tests, then, consisted of these
steps:

   * Copying all the C code into the test directory.  These tests were
     based on the C-torture test created by Torbjorn Granlund (on behalf
     of the Free Software Foundation) for GCC development.

   * Writing (and debugging) the generic Tcl procedures for compilation.

   * Writing the simple test driver: its main task is to search the
     directory (using the Tcl procedure _glob_ for filename expansion
     with wildcards) and call a Tcl procedure with each filename.  It
     also checks for a few errors from the testing procedure.

   Testing interactive programs is intrinsically more complex.  Tests
for most interactive programs require some trial and error before they
are complete.

   However, some interactive programs can be tested in a simple fashion
reminiscent of batch tests.  For example, prior to the creation of
DejaGnu, the GDB distribution already included a wide-ranging testing
procedure.  This procedure was very robust, and had already undergone
much more debugging and error checking than many recent DejaGnu test
cases.  Accordingly, the best approach was simply to encapsulate the
existing GDB tests, for reporting purposes.  Thereafter, new GDB tests
built up a family of Tcl procedures specialized for GDB testing.

5.6.1 Hints on writing a test case
----------------------------------

To preserve basic sanity, no should test ever pass if there was any kind
of problem in the test case.  To take an extreme case, tests that pass
even when the tool will not spawn are misleading.  Ideally, a test in
this sort of situation should not fail either.  Instead, print an error
message by calling one of the DejaGnu procedures 'perror' or 'warning'.
Note that using 'perror' will cause the next text result to be reported
as 'UNRESOLVED', so printing an error and allowing the test to fail is a
good option.

   If you have trouble understanding why a pattern does not match the
program output, try using the '--debug' option to 'runtest', and examine
the debug log carefully.

   If you use glob patterns, you will need to escape any '*', '?', '[',
']', and '\' characters that are meant to match literally.  If you use
regular expressions, see the 're_syntax(n)' manual page from Tcl for the
syntax details, and be sure to understand what punctuation characters
match literally and what characters have special meanings in regular
expressions.

   Tcl has a few options for quoting; the most notable are '{}' and
'""'.  These quotes behave differently: '{}' must balance, while '""'
performs various interpolations.  In '{}' quotes, unbalanced '{' or '}'
characters must be escaped with '\' and these escapes are _not_ removed;
fortunately, backslash-escaped braces match literal braces in Tcl
regular expressions.  In '""' quotes, any embedded '"' characters must
be escaped, a literal '$' begins a variable substitution, and unescaped
'[]' introduce a Tcl command substitution.

Synchronization with the tested program
.......................................

A DejaGnu testsuite executes concurrently with the programs that it
tests.  As a result, DejaGnu may see parts of the tested program's
output while the tested program is still producing more output.  Expect
patterns must be written to handle the possibility that incomplete
output from the tested program will be considered for matching.

   Expect reads the output from the tested program into an internal
matching buffer and removes everything from the start of the buffer to
the end of the match when a match is found.  Any given character can be
matched at most once, or skipped if a match is found starting later in
the buffer or the buffer reaches its capacity.  Anything left in the
buffer after the end of the match remains in the buffer and is
considered for the next 'expect' command.  If 'expect' is invoked and no
patterns match, Expect waits for more text to arrive.  New text is
appended to the buffer as it is read.  If the buffer reaches its
capacity, the entire contents of the buffer are discarded and Expect
resumes reading.

   In Expect patterns, the regular expression anchors '^' and '$' match
at the beginning and end of the _buffer_, not at line boundaries.  The
'$' anchor must be used with care because it will match at the end of
what Expect _has_ read, but the program may have produced more output
that Expect _has not yet_ read.  Similarly, regular expressions ending
with the '*' quantifier can potentially match a prefix of the intended
text, only for the rest to arrive shortly thereafter.

   Maintaining synchronization with the tested program is easier if the
patterns match all of the output generated by the tested program; this
is called closure.

   For interactive programs, a prompt is usually a good synchronization
point, provided that the program's prompt can be uniquely recognized.
Since the prompt is usually the last output until the program receives
further input, the '$' anchor can be useful here.

   If the output from the tested program is organized into lines,
matching end-of-line using '\n' is usually a good way to process one
line at a time.  Note that terminal settings may result in the insertion
of additional '\r' characters, usually translating '\n' to '\r\n'.

   Be careful not to neglect output generated by setup rather than by
the interesting parts of a test case.  For example, while testing GDB, a
'set height 0\n' command is issued.  The purpose is simply to make sure
GDB never calls a paging program.  The 'set height' command in GDB does
not generate any output; but running any command makes GDB issue a new
'(gdb) ' prompt.  If there were no 'expect' command to match this
prompt, the '(gdb) ' prompt will remain in the buffer and begin the text
seen by the next 'expect' command--which might make that pattern fail to
match.

Priority of Expect patterns
...........................

Be particularly careful about how you write the patterns.  Expect
attempts to match each pattern in the order that they are written in the
'expect' command.  Unless a regexp pattern is anchored at the beginning
of the buffer, Expect can search ahead for a match for a pattern that
appears earlier in the 'expect' command and skip over text that would
match a later pattern.  _The text thus skipped is discarded._  This is a
source of very hard to trace bugs, especially when reading input from
batch-oriented unit tests.

   For example, consider a simple model once used by the DejaGnu
testsuite for unit testing.  In this example, a test has failed, but the
tests before and after it have passed.  First the relevant input to
DejaGnu:

     PASSED: foo
     FAILED: bar
     PASSED: baz

   The test script is reading this with two Expect patterns, simplified
for this example by omitting handling of the actual messages and other
possible results:

     expect {
            -re {PASSED: [^\r\n]+[\r\n]+} { pass ... }
            -re {FAILED: [^\r\n]+[\r\n]+} { fail ... }
     }

   At every cycle, Expect attempts to match each pattern in the order
that they are written against the available input.  If DejaGnu is
processing the input as quickly as it arrives, this example will
actually work.  However, if the system scheduler sets DejaGnu aside for
a bit, or the external program produces output in a burst, Expect can
find that its input buffer contains the text in the first example above
all at once as the cycle begins.

   If this occurs, Expect will first attempt to match '{PASSED:
[^\r\n]+[\r\n]+}' against the input and will succeed, since the input
begins with 'PASSED: foo'.  The 'pass' procedure is called and the test
result recorded.  Expect then starts a new matching cycle.

   If the input had been presented one line at a time, the expected
result would occur: the '{FAILED: [^\r\n]+[\r\n]+}' pattern would match
and the test driver would work correctly.  But we are considering the
case where all three lines arrived "at once" so we must examine what
Expect will do in this case.  After the first line has been processed,
the Expect buffer now contains:

     FAILED: bar
     PASSED: baz

   Expect again attempts to match each pattern in order.  Expect will
attempt to match '{PASSED: [^\r\n]+[\r\n]+}' before attempting to match
'{FAILED: [^\r\n]+[\r\n]+}' and the first attempt succeeds because the
pattern is not anchored.  The 'FAILED: bar' message is simply discarded
when Expect finds the later 'PASSED:baz' message in the buffer.

   How to prevent this?  There are two ways: either group all of your
test matches into a single regexp using alternation, or ensure that all
patterns can match only at the start of Expect's buffer.  Both options
can be made to work.  Grouping all status results into a single regexp
allows some other unspecified text to still be silently discarded, while
ensuring that all patterns are anchored absolutely requires closure, as
any unmatched text will cause Expect to run out of buffer space.  Expect
discards the entire buffer when this occurs.

5.7 Debugging a test case
=========================

These are the kinds of debugging information available from DejaGnu:

   * Output controlled by test scripts themselves, explicitly allowed
     for by the test author.  This kind of debugging output appears in
     the detailed output recorded in the DejaGnu log file.  To do the
     same for new tests, use the 'verbose' procedure (which in turn uses
     the Tcl variable 'verbose') to control how much output to generate.
     This will make it easier for other people running the test to debug
     it if necessary.  If 'verbose' is zero, there should be no output
     other than the output from the framework (eg.  FAIL). Then, to
     whatever extent is appropriate for the particular test, allow
     successively higher values of 'verbose' to generate more
     information.  Be kind to other programmers who use your tests -
     provide plenty of debugging information.

   * Output from the internal debugging functions of Tcl and Expect.
     There is a command line options for each; both forms of debugging
     output are recorded in the file 'dbg.log' in the current directory.

     Use '--debug' for information from Expect.  It logs how Expect
     attempts to match the tool output with the patterns specified.
     This can be very helpful while developing test scripts, since it
     shows precisely the characters received.  Iterating between the
     latest attempt at a new test script and the corresponding 'dbg.log'
     can allow you to create the final patterns by "cut and paste".
     This is sometimes the best way to write a test case.

   * Use '--strace' to see more detail from Tcl.  This logs how Tcl
     procedure definitions are expanded as they execute.  The trace
     level argument controls the depth of definitions expanded.

   * If the value of 'verbose' is 3 or greater ('runtest -v -v -v'),
     DejaGnu activates the Expect command 'log_user'.  This command
     prints all Expect actions to standard output, to the '.log' file
     and, if '--debug' is given, to 'dbg.log'.

5.8 Adding a test case to a testsuite
=====================================

There are two slightly different ways to add a test case.  One is to add
the test case to an existing directory.  The other is to create a new
directory to hold your test.  The existing test directories represent
several styles of testing, all of which are slightly different.  Examine
the testsuite subdirectories for the tool of interest to see which
approach is most suitable.

   Adding a GCC test may be very simple: just add the source file to any
test directory beginning with 'gcc.' and it will be tested on the next
test run.

   Adding a test by creating a new directory involves:

  1. Create the new directory.  All subdirectory names begin with the
     name of the tool to test; e.g.  G++ tests might be in a directory
     called 'g++.other'.  There can be multiple testsuite subdirectories
     with the same tool name prefix.

  2. Add the new test case to the directory, as above.

5.9 Test case special variables
===============================

There are special variables that contain other information from DejaGnu.
Your test cases can inspect these variables, as well as the variables
saved in 'site.exp'.  These variables should never be changed.

'$prms_id'
     The bug tracking system (eg.  PRMS/GNATS) number identifying a
     corresponding bug report (_0_ if you do not specify it).

'$bug_id'
     An optional bug ID, perhaps a bug identification number from
     another organization (_0_ if you do not specify it).

'$subdir'
     The subdirectory for the current test case.

'$exec_output'
     This is the output from a '${tool}_load' command.  This only
     applies to tools like GCC and GAS which produce an object file that
     must in turn be executed to complete a test.

'$comp_output'
     This is the output from a '${tool}_start' command.  This is
     conventionally used for batch-oriented programs, like GCC and GAS,
     that may produce interesting output (warnings, errors) without
     further interaction.

'$expect_out(buffer)'
     The output from the last command.  This is an internal variable set
     by Expect.  More information can be found in the Expect manual.

6 Unit testing
**************

6.1 What is unit testing?
=========================

Most regression testing as done by DejaGnu is system testing: the
complete application is tested all at once.  Unit testing is for testing
single files, or small libraries.  In this case, each file is linked
with a test case in C or C++, and each function or class and method is
tested in turn, with the test case having to check private data or
global variables to see if the function or method worked.

   This works particularly well for testing APIs at a level where it is
easier to debug them, than by needing to trace through the entire
application.  Also if there is a specification for the API to be tested,
the testcase can also function as a compliance test.

6.2 Running unit tests
======================

The native DejaGnu unit testing support is provided by a library module
'dejagnu.exp' and the procedure 'host_execute' is called by testsuite
code to run unit tests.

     host_execute program arguments

   The 'host_execute' procedure runs program, passing arguments on the
command line, and examines the output for test result messages according
to the DejaGnu unit testing protocol.

   If successful, the return value is an empty string.  Otherwise, an
error message is returned.

6.3 DejaGnu unit test protocol
==============================

DejaGnu spawns a unit test program and reads that program's output.
Arguments for the unit test program can be specified in the testsuite.

   Unit test programs may produce any output for the benefit of a
developer running them directly or reading the DejaGnu log, but output
matching the Tcl regexp '{\n\t[][[:upper:]]*:}' (a tab character at the
beginning of a line, followed by any sequence of uppercase letters and
square brackets, followed by a colon) should be considered reserved for
future extension.  Future versions of DejaGnu will interpret more lines
matching this pattern as additional unit test information.

   -|        NOTE: text

   This will cause text to be printed at verbose levels 2 and higher.

   -|        PASSED: name

   -|        FAILED: name

   -|        XPASSED: name

   -|        XFAILED: name

   -|        UNTESTED: name

   -|        UNRESOLVED: name

   These indicate simple test results.

   Note that all output from a unit test program, including the lines
recognized and interpreted by DejaGnu, appears in the log.

6.4 C unit testing API
======================

The C API is provided in the 'dejagnu.h' header file.  This header
provides a self-contained implementation.  For convenience, the
'totals()' function can be called at the end of the unit test program to
output summary totals.  DejaGnu counts the test results independently
and will operate correctly even if 'totals()' is never invoked.

   All of the functions that take a 'msg' parameter use a C 'char *'
that is the message to be displayed.  All of the functions that display
a message accept a 'printf'-style format string and variable arguments.

   * 'note' emits a note that will be displayed at verbose level 2 or
     higher.

          note(msg, ...);

   * 'pass' prints a message for a successful test completion.

          pass(msg, ...);

   * 'fail' prints a message for an unsuccessful test completion.

          fail(msg, ...);

   * 'xfail' prints a message for an expected unsuccessful test
     completion.

          xfail(msg, ...);

   * 'xpass' prints a message for an unexpected successful test
     completion.

          xpass(msg, ...);

   * 'untested' prints a placeholder message for a test case that is not
     yet implemented or that could not be run for some reason.

          untested(msg, ...);

   * 'unresolved' prints a message for a test case that was run, but did
     not produce a clear result.  These output states require a human to
     look over the results to determine what happened.

          unresolved(msg, ...);

   * 'totals' prints out the total counts of all of the test results as
     a convenience when running the unit test program directly.  DejaGnu
     does not use this information and instead counts the results
     independently.

          totals();

6.5 C++ unit testing API
========================

The C++ API is also provided in the 'dejagnu.h' header file.  This
header provides a self-contained implementation.  For convenience, the
'totals()' method outputs summary totals to be used at the end of unit
test program.  DejaGnu does not depend on this summary and counts the
test results independently.

   All of the methods that take a 'msg' parameter use a STL string as
the message to be displayed.  There currently is no support for
formatted output in the C++ API; build the desired string before passing
it to these functions.

   Note that the C API is also available in C++ unit test programs;
using both will cause confusion because each 'TestState' object carries
its own set of summary counters, while the C API has an independent
global set of summary counters.

   The 'TestState' class supports the following instance methods:

   * 'pass' prints a message for a successful test completion.

          TestState::pass(msg);

   * 'fail' prints a message for an unsuccessful test completion.

          TestState::fail(msg);

   * 'xfail' prints a message for an expected unsuccessful test
     completion.

          TestState::xfail(msg);

   * 'xpass' prints a message for an unexpected successful test
     completion.

          TestState::xpass(msg);

   * 'untested' prints a placeholder message for a test case that is not
     yet implemented or that could not be run for some reason.

          TestState::untested(msg);

   * 'unresolved' prints a message for a test case that was run, but did
     not produce a clear result.  These output states require a human to
     look over the results to determine what happened.

          TestState::unresolved(msg);

   * 'totals' prints out the total counts of all of the test results as
     a convenience when running the unit test program directly.  DejaGnu
     does not use this information and instead counts the results
     independently.

     In the C++ API, this method is automatically called when a
     'TestState' instance is destroyed.

          TestState::totals();

as a link to a bug-tracking system such as GNATS.

   Once you use 'setup_xfail', the 'fail' and 'pass' procedures produce
the messages _XFAIL_ and _XPASS_ respectively, allowing you to
distinguish expected failures (and unexpected success!)  from other test
outcomes.

     *Warning*

     Warning you must clear the expected failure after using setup_xfail
     in a test case.  Any call to 'pass 'or 'fail' clears the expected
     failure implicitly; if the test has some other outcome, e.g.  an
     error, you can call 'clear_xfail' to clear the expected failure
     explicitly.  Otherwise, the expected-failure declaration applies to
     whatever test runs next, leading to surprising results.

     setup_xfail config bugid

'config'
     The config triplet to trigger whether this is an unexpected or
     expect failure.

'bugid'
     The optional bugid, used to tie this test case to a bug tracking
     system.

pass Procedure
..............

Declares a test to have passed.  'pass' writes in the log files a
message beginning with _PASS_ (or _XPASS_, if failure was expected),
appending the 'message' argument.

     pass message

fail Procedure
..............

Declares a test to have failed.  'fail' writes in the log files a
message beginning with _FAIL_ (or _XFAIL_, if failure was expected),
appending the 'message' argument.

     fail message

xpass Procedure
...............

Declares a test to have passed when it was expected to fail.  'xpass'
writes in the log files a message beginning with _XPASS_ (or _XFAIL_ if
failure was expected) and the 'message' argument.

     xpass message

xfail Procedure
...............

Declares a test to have expectedly failed.  'xfail' writes in the log
files a message beginning with _XFAIL_ (or _PASS_, if success was
expected), appending the 'message' argument.

     xpass message

set_warning_threshold Procedure
...............................

Sets the value of 'warning_threshold'.  A value of _0_ disables it:
calls to 'warning' will not turn a _PASS_ or _FAIL_ into an
_UNRESOLVED_.

     set_warning_threshold threshold

'threshold'
     This is the value of the new warning threshold.

get_warning_threshold Procedure
...............................

Returns the current value of '{warning_threshold'.  The default value is
3.  This value controls how many 'warning' procedures can be called
before becoming _UNRESOLVED_.

     get_warning_threshold

warning Procedure
.................

Declares detection of a minor error in the test case itself.  'warning'
writes in the log files a message beginning with _WARNING_, appending
the argument 'string'.  Use 'warning' rather than 'perror' for cases
(such as communication failure to be followed by a retry) where the test
case can recover from the error.  If the optional 'number' is supplied,
then this is used to set the internal count of warnings to that value.

   As a side effect, 'warning_threshold' or more calls to warning in a
single test case also changes the effect of the next 'pass' or 'fail'
command: the test outcome becomes _UNRESOLVED_ since an automatic _PASS_
or _FAIL_ may not be trustworthy after many warnings.  If the optional
numeric value is _0_, then there are no further side effects to calling
this function, and the following test outcome doesn't become
_UNRESOLVED_. This can be used for errors with no known side effects.

     warning messsage number

'message'
     The warning message.

'number'
     The optional number to set the error counter.  This is only used to
     fake out the counter when using the 'xfail' procedure to control
     when it flips the output over to _UNRESOLVED_ state.

perror Procedure
................

Declares a severe error in the testing framework itself.  'perror'
writes in the log files a message beginning with _ERROR_, appending the
argument 'string'.

   As a side effect, perror also changes the effect of the next 'pass'
or 'fail' command: the test outcome becomes _UNRESOLVED_, since an
automatic _PASS_ or _FAIL_ cannot be trusted after a severe error in the
test framework.  If the optional numeric value is _0_, then there are no
further side effects to calling this function, and the following test
outcome doesn't become _UNRESOLVED_. This can be used for errors with no
known side effects.

     perror message number

'message'
     The message to be logged.

'number'
     The optional number to set the error counter.  This is only used to
     fake out the counter when using the 'xfail' procedure to control
     when it flips the output over to _UNRESOLVED_ state.

note Procedure
..............

Appends an informational message to the log file.  'note' writes in the
log files a message beginning with _NOTE_, appending the 'message'
argument.  Use 'note' sparingly.  The 'verbose' should be used for most
such messages, but in cases where a message is needed in the log file
regardless of the verbosity level use 'note'.

     note messsage

untested Procedure
..................

Declares a test was not run.  'untested' writes in the log file a
message beginning with _UNTESTED_, appending the 'message' argument.
For example, you might use this in a dummy test whose only role is to
record that a test does not yet exist for some feature.

     untested message

unresolved Procedure
....................

Declares a test to have an unresolved outcome.  'unresolved' writes in
the log file a message beginning with _UNRESOLVED_, appending the
'message' argument.  This usually means the test did not execute as
expected, and a human being must go over results to determine if it
passed or failed (and to improve the test case).

     unresolved message

unsupported Procedure
.....................

Declares that a test case depends on some facility that does not exist
in the testing environment.  'unsupported' writes in the log file a
message beginning with _UNSUPPORTED_, appending the 'message' argument.

     unsupported message

transform Procedure
...................

Generates a string for the name of a tool as it was configured and
installed, given its native name (as the argument 'toolname').  This
makes the assumption that all tools are installed using the same naming
conventions: For example, for a cross compiler supporting the
_m68k-vxworks_ configuration, the result of transform 'gcc' is
'm68k-vxworks-gcc'.

     transform toolname

'toolname'
     The name of the cross-development program to transform.

check_conditional_xfail Procedure
.................................

This procedure adds a conditional xfail, based on compiler options used
to create a test case executable.  If an include options is found in the
compiler flags, and it's the right architecture, it'll trigger an
_XFAIL_. Otherwise it'll produce an ordinary _FAIL_. You can also
specify flags to exclude.  This makes a result be a _FAIL_, even if the
included options are found.  To set the conditional, set the variable
'compiler_conditional_xfail_data' to the fields

     "[message string] [targets list] [includes list] [excludes list]"

   (descriptions below).  This is the checked at pass/fail decision
time, so there is no need to call the procedure yourself, unless you
wish to know if it gets triggered.  After a pass/fail, the variable is
reset, so it doesn't effect other tests.  It returns _1_ if the
conditional is true, or _0_ if the conditional is false.

     check_conditional_xfail message targets includes excludes

'message'
     This is the message to print with the normal test result.

'targets'
     This is a string with the list targets to activate this conditional
     on.

'includes'
     This is a list of sets of options to search for in the compiler
     options to activate this conditional.  If the list of sets of
     options is empty or if any set of the options matches, then this
     conditional is true.  (It may be useful to specify an empty list of
     include sets if the conditional is always true unless one of the
     exclude sets matches.)

'excludes'
     This is a list of sets of options to search for in the compiler
     options to activate this conditional.  If any set of the options
     matches, (regardless of whether any of the include sets match) then
     this conditional is de-activated.

   *Specifying the conditional xfail data*

     set compiler_conditional_xfail_data { \
          "I sure wish I knew why this was hosed" \
          "sparc*-sun*-* *-pc-*-*" \
          {"-Wall -v" "-O3"} \
          {"-O1" "-Map"} \
     }

   What this does is it matches only for these two targets if '-Wall -v'
or '-O3' is set, but neither '-O1' or '-Map' is set.  For a set to
match, the options specified are searched for independently of each
other, so a '-Wall -v' matches either '-Wall -v' or '-v -Wall'.  A space
separates the options in the string.  Glob patterns are also permitted.

clear_xfail Procedure
.....................

Cancel an expected failure (previously declared with 'setup_xfail') for
a particular set of configurations.  The 'config' argument is a list of
configuration target names.  It is only necessary to call 'clear_xfail'
if a test case ends without calling either 'pass' or 'fail', after
calling 'setup_xfail'.

     clear_xfail config

'config'
     The system triplets to clear.

verbose Procedure
.................

Test cases can use this procedure to issue helpful messages depending on
the number of '-v'/'--verbose' options passed on the command line to
'runtest'.  It prints message if the value of the number of '-v' options
passed is greater than or equal to the loglevel argument.  The default
log level is 1.

     verbose -log -x -n message loglevel

'-log'
     Always write message to the log file, even if it won't be printed
     on the console.

'-x'
     Log the message into an XML file.

'-n'
     Print message without a trailing newline.

'--'
     Use this option if message begins with '-'.

'message'
     The log messsage.

'loglevel'
     The specified log level.  The default level is 1.

load_lib Procedure
..................

'load_lib' loads a DejaGnu library file by searching the default fixed
paths built into DejaGnu.  If DejaGnu has been installed, it looks in a
path starting with the installed library directory.  If you are running
DejaGnu directly from a source directory, without first running 'make
install', this path defaults to the current directory.  In either case,
it then looks in the current directory for a directory called 'lib'.  If
there are duplicate definitions, the last one loaded takes precedence
over the earlier ones.

     load_lib filespec

'filespec'
     The name of the DejaGnu library file to load.

   The global variable 'libdirs', handled as a list, is appended to the
default fixed paths built into DejaGnu.

   *Additional search directories for load_lib*

     # append a non-standard search path
     global libdirs
     lappend libdirs $srcdir/../../gcc/testsuite/lib
     # now loading $srcdir/../../gcc/testsuite/lib/foo.exp works
     load_lib foo.exp

testsuite Procedure
...................

The 'testsuite' procedure is a multiplex call for retrieving or
providing information about the current testsuite.

testsuite file
..............

The 'testsuite file' command returns an absolute file name specified
relative to either the testsuite source or object trees.

     testsuite file ?-source|-object? -top|-test ?-hypothetical? ?-?
     name...

   Any number of names are accepted and combined as if by 'file join'
with a directory relevant to the testsuite prepended.

'-object'
     Return a file name in the object tree.

'-source'
     Return a file name in the source tree.

'-top'
     Prepend the 'testsuite' directory itself.

'-test'
     Prepend the directory containing the current test script.

'-hypothetical'
     Allow the returned value to imply directories that do not exist.

'--'
     Use this option if the first name could begin with '-'.

   One of '-top' or '-test' must be given; an error is raised otherwise.

   Unless the '-hypothetical' option is given, any directories implied
by the returned value will exist upon return.  Implied directories are
created in the object tree if needed.  An error is raised if an implied
directory does not exist in the source tree.

testsuite can call
..................

The 'testsuite can call' command is a feature test and returns a boolean
value indicating if a subcommand under a multiplex point is available.
This API call is needed because only the multiplex points themselves are
visible to the Tcl info command.

     testsuite can call feature...

   Any number of words are joined together into a single name, beginning
with a multiplex entry point and forming the full name of an API call as
documented in this manual.

testcase Procedure
..................

The 'testcase' procedure is a multiplex call for retrieving or providing
information about the state of the testing process.

testcase group
..............

The 'testcase group' command provides support for grouping tests into
hierarchical groups within a test script.

   Group names are internally tracked as Tcl lists, but are reported as
strings delimited using forward slash ('/') characters.  Individual name
elements may not contain whitespace, but may contain forward slash.  A
group entered by traversing intermediate levels must be left by
traversing those same levels.  Groups must properly nest.

   There are three uses:

     testcase group

   Return the current group as a string delimited with forward slash
('/') characters.

     testcase group begin name
     testcase group end name

   These forms allow a group to be explicitly entered and left.  The
name parameter must be identical across a pair of these calls, and both
the 'begin' and 'end' calls must be in the same file.

     testcase group eval name {code}

   This form is available to wrap the 'begin' and 'end' calls around the
execution of the provided code.  This form is preferred for convenience
in top-level scripts, but the 'begin' and 'end' calls are preferred in
helper procedures for performance.

A.2 Procedures For Remote Communication
=======================================

The file 'lib/remote.exp' defines procedures for establishing and
managing communications.  Each of these procedures tries to establish
the connection up to three times before returning.  Warnings (if retries
will continue) or errors (if the attempt is abandoned) report on
communication failures.  The result for any of these procedures is
either _-1_, when the connection cannot be established, or the spawn ID
returned by the Expect command 'spawn'.

   It use the value of the 'connect' field in the 'target_info' array as
the type of connection to make.  Current supported connection types are
ssh, tip, kermit, telnet, rsh, and rlogin.  If the '--reboot' option was
used on the 'runtest' command line, then the target is rebooted before
the connection is made.

call_remote Procedure
.....................

A standard procedure to call the appropriate proc.  This proceure first
looks for a board-specific version, then a protocol-specific version,
and finally 'call_remote' will call 'standard_$proc'.

     call_remote type proc dest args

'proc'
'dest'
'args'

check_for_board_status Procedure
................................

for the expected output from the status wrapper.  A non-negative value
is returned if it exists.  Otherwise, it returns -1.  The output from
the status wrapper is removed from the variable.

     check_for_board_status variable

'variable'
     The name of the variable to check in the calling procedure.  Be
     sure to pass the name of the variable ('var') and not the value of
     the variable ('$var').

file 'inp' (if non-empty), redirecting output to file 'outp' (if
non-empty), and waiting 'timeout' seconds for the command to complete
before killing it.  A two-element list is returned: the exit status of
the command and any output produced by the command.  If output is
redirected, this may or may not be empty.  If output is redirected, both
stdout and stderr will appear in the specified file.

     local_exec commandline inp outp timeout

'inp'
     Redirect input into the input filename if not set to '""'.

'outp'
     Redirect output into the output filename if not set to '""'.

'timeout'
     Timeout in seconds.

remote_binary Procedure
.......................

This procedure sets the connection into binary mode.  That is, there is
no processing of input characters.

     remote_binary host

'host'
     The host on which to set a binary connection.

remote_close Procedure
......................

     remote_close shellid

'shellid'
     This is the value returned by a call to 'remote_open'.  This closes
     the connection to the target so resources can be used by others.
     This parameter can be left off if the 'fileid' field in the
     'target_info' array is set.

remote_download Procedure
.........................

'args'
     If the optional destination filename is specified, that filename
     will be used on the destination machine.

remote_exec Procedure
.....................

Execute the supplied program on a remote host.  A two-element list is
returned.  The first element is the exit status of the program or -1 if
execution failed.  The second element is any output produced by the
program.  This may be an empty string if output from the program was
redirected.

     remote_exec hostname program ?options? ?input? ?output? ?timeout?

'target_info' array be filled in with the proper information to work.
It returns the spawn id of the process that is the connection.

     remote_open type

'type'
     This is passed 'host' or 'target'.  Host or target refers to
     whether it is a connection to a remote target, or a remote host.
     This opens the connection to the desired target or host using the
     default values in the configuration system.  It returns that
     'spawn_id' of the process that manages the connection.  This value
     can be used in Expect or 'exp_send' statements, or passed to other
     procedures that need the connection process's id.  This also sets
     the 'fileid' field in the 'target_info' array.

target_assemble Procedure
.........................

     target_assemble source destfile flags

'source'
'destfile'
'flags'

target_compile Procedure
........................

     target_compile source destfile type options

'source'
     Source file or other arguments if TYPE is 'none'.
'destfile'
     Destination file or empty string to request output as return value.
'type'
     Type of output that should be produced.
     'none'         Special applications where no source is actually given.
     'preprocess'   Run the source files through the C preprocessor.
     'assembly'     Produce assembler source from the compiler.
     'object'       Produce binary object files.
     'executable'   Produce an executable program.
'options'
     List of additional options:

     Language-selection options:
     'ada'
          Use an Ada compiler.
     'c++'
          Use a C++ compiler.
     'd'
          Use a compiler for the D language.
     'f77'
          Use a compiler for Fortran 77.
     'f90'
          Use a compiler for Fortran 90.
     'go'
          Use a compiler for Go.
     'rust'
          Use a compiler for Rust.
     If none of these options are given, the C compiler is used by
     default.  Giving multiple language-selection options is an error.

     The 'f77' option generally selects the 'g77' compiler, while the
     'f90' option selects the newer 'gfortran' frontend.  Both of these
     can compile Fortran 77, but only 'gfortran' supports Fortran 90.

     Search path options:
     'incdir=DIR'
          Additional directory to search for preprocessor include files.
          Multiple uses of this option add multiple directories to the
          search path.
     'libdir=DIR'
          Additional directory to search for libraries.  Multiple uses
          of this option add multiple directories to the search path.

     Target options:
     'debug'
          Compile with debugging information.  Multiple uses of this
          option are treated as a single use.
     'dest=TARGET'
          Override the current target and compile for TARGET instead.
          If this option is given multiple times, only the last use is
          significant.
     'compiler=COMMAND'
          Override the defaults and use COMMAND as the compiler.  If
          this option is given multiple times, only the last use is
          significant.
     'linker=COMMAND'
          Override the defaults and use COMMAND to build executables.
          If this option is given multiple times, only the last use is
          significant.
     'early_flags=FLAGS'
          Prepend FLAGS to the set of arguments to be passed to the
          compiler.  Multiple uses of this option specify additional
          arguments.
     'additional_flags=FLAGS'
          Add FLAGS to the set of arguments to be passed to the
          compiler.  Multiple uses of this option specify additional
          arguments.
     'optimize=FLAGS'
          Specify optimization flags to be passed to the compiler.
          Nothing enforces that the flags given with option must
          actually be related to optimization, however.  If this option
          is given multiple times, only the last use is significant.
     'ldflags=FLAGS'
          Add FLAGS to the set of arguments to be passed to the linker.
          Note that these are passed literally to the compiler driver,
          without adding a special prefix to each option.  If a '-Wl,'
          prefix is needed with GCC, it must be included in the given
          FLAGS.  As a group, the linker flags are only used if an
          executable is requested and are given special treatment with
          some languages.  Multiple uses of this option specify
          additional arguments.
     'ldscript=SCRIPT'
          Specify a linker script, or more precisely, the argument to
          pass to the linker via the compiler driver to select a linker
          script.  The SCRIPT value is passed literally to the compiler
          driver.  If this option is given multiple times, only the last
          use is significant.
     'libs=LIBS'
          Specify additional libraries to be included in the link.  The
          LIBS value is a space-separated list of libraries to include.
          Each element is checked, and if a file exists with that exact
          name, it is added to the list of sources to be given to the
          compiler.  Otherwise, the element is passed literally to the
          compiler driver after any linker flags specified with the
          'ldflags' option.  Multiple uses of this option specify
          additional lists, which are concatenated in the order they are
          given.

     Execution options:
     'timeout=TIMEOUT'
          Abort the compile job if it is still running after TIMEOUT
          seconds.  This is intended for compiler tests that are known
          to cause infinite loops upon failure.
     'redirect=FILE'
          Instead of returning output emitted on 'stdout', place it into
          FILE.

   The 'target_compile' procedure also uses several global Tcl variables
as overrides:
'CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET'
     If 'CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET' is set, its value is prepended to the flags
     otherwise prepared for the compiler, even ahead of any
     board-specific flags inserted as a result of a language-selection
     option.
'LDFLAGS_FOR_TARGET'
     If 'LDFLAGS_FOR_TARGET' is set, the set of arguments to be passed
     to linker is initialized to its value instead of an empty list.
     The 'ldflags' option appends to this list.
'CC_FOR_TARGET'
     Override default compiler.  If no other compiler is given and this
     variable is set, its value will be used instead of searching for a
     compiler or using the default from the target board configuration.
     The 'compiler' option overrides this variable.
'CXX_FOR_TARGET'
     Override C++ compiler.  If the 'c++' option is given, this compiler
     will be used and the 'compiler' option ignored.
'D_FOR_TARGET'
     Override D language compiler.  If the 'd' option is given, this
     compiler will be used and the 'compiler' option ignored.
'F77_FOR_TARGET'
     Override Fortran 77 compiler.  If the 'f77' option is given, this
     compiler will be used and the 'compiler' option ignored.
'F90_FOR_TARGET'
     Override Fortran 90 compiler.  If the 'f90' option is given, this
     compiler will be used and the 'compiler' option ignored.
'GO_FOR_TARGET'
     Override Go compiler.  If the 'go' option is given, this compiler
     will be used and the 'compiler' option ignored.
'GO_LD_FOR_TARGET'
     Override Go linker.  If the 'go' option is given, this linker will
     be used.
'RUSTC_FOR_TARGET'
     Override Rust compiler.  If the 'rust' option is given, this
     compiler will be used and the 'compiler' option ignored.
'GNATMAKE_FOR_TARGET'
     Override Ada compiler.  If the 'ada' option is given, this compiler
     will be used and the 'compiler' option ignored.

   The 'target_compile' procedure obtains most defaults from the target
board configuration, but additionally inserts any flags specified as
'cflags_for_target' on the _host_ board configuration.  If no host is
set, the 'unix' board configuration is checked for a 'cflags_for_target'
key.  If the 'cflags_for_target' key exists, its value is inserted into
the set of arguments given to the compiler after any arguments given
with the 'additional_flags' option.

   In DejaGnu 1.6.2 and older, this mechanism did not work reliably and
the 'unix' board configuration was always searched for the
'cflags_for_target' key, regardless of the host board selected.

   Also in DejaGnu 1.6.2 and older, the 'dest' option interacted very
badly with the language-selection options.  There was no correct way to
combine these options because the language-specific defaults would be
read from the current target board configuration instead of the board
configuration specified with the 'dest' option.  The closest solution
was to always specify the language-selection option first, but this
results in defaults appropriate for the current target, instead of the
target selected with the 'dest' option.

A.6 Platform Dependent Procedures
=================================

Each combination of target and tool requires some target-dependent
procedures.  The names of these procedures have a common form: the tool
name, followed by an underscore ___, and finally a suffix describing the
procedure's purpose.  For example, a procedure to extract the version
from GDB is called 'gdb_version'.

   'runtest' itself calls only two of these procedures, '${tool}_exit'
and '${tool}_version'; these procedures use no arguments.

   The other two procedures, '${tool}_start' and '${tool}_load', are
only called by the test suites themselves (or by testsuite-specific
initialization code); they may take arguments or not, depending on the
conventions used within each testsuite.

   The usual convention for return codes from any of these procedures
(although it is not required by 'runtest') is to return _0_ if the
procedure succeeded, _1_ if it failed, and _-1_ if there was a
communication error.

${tool}_start Procedure
.......................

Starts a particular tool.  For an interactive tool, '${tool}_start'
starts and initializes the tool, leaving the tool up and running for the
test cases; an example is 'gdb_start', the start function for GDB. For a
batch-oriented tool, '${tool}_start' is optional; the recommended
convention is to let '${tool}_start' run the tool, leaving the output in
a variable called 'comp_output'.  Test scripts can then analyze
'$comp_output' to determine the test results.  An example of this second
kind of start function is 'gcc_start', the start function for GCC.

   DejaGnu itself does not call '${tool}_start'.  The initialization
module '${tool}_init.exp' must call '${tool}_start' for interactive
tools; for batch-oriented tools, each individual test script calls
'${tool}_start' (or makes other arrangements to run the tool).

     ${tool}_start

${tool}_load Procedure
......................

Loads something into a tool.  For an interactive tool, this conditions
the tool for a particular test case; for example, 'gdb_load' loads a new
executable file into the debugger.  For batch-oriented tools,
'${tool}_load' may do nothing--though, for example, the GCC support uses
'gcc_load' to load and run a binary on the target environment.
Conventionally, '${tool}_load' leaves the output of any program it runs
in a variable called '$exec_output'.  Writing '${tool}_load' can be the
most complex part of extending DejaGnu to a new tool or a new target, if
it requires much communication coding or file downloading.  Test scripts
call '${tool}_load'.

     ${tool}_load

${tool}_exit Procedure
......................

Cleans up (if necessary) before DejaGnu exits.  For interactive tools,
this usually ends the interactive session.  You can also use
'${tool}_exit' to remove any temporary files left over from the tests.
'runtest' calls '${tool}_exit'.

     ${tool}_exit

${tool}_version Procedure
.........................

Prints the version label and number for '${tool}'.  This is called by
the DejaGnu procedure that prints the final summary report.  The output
should consist of the full path name used for the tested tool, and its
version number.

     ${tool}_version

A.7 Utility Procedures
======================

getdirs Procedure
.................

Returns a list of all the subdirectories in a single directory that
match a glob pattern.  If no directories match the pattern, then an
empty list is returned.

   This procedure is specialized as a search for tests in testsuites:
'getdirs' ignores directories named 'testsuite', 'config', or 'lib', and
also ignores directories associated with a few revision control systems,
specifically Git ('.git'), Subversion ('.svn'), CVS ('CVS'), RCS
('RCS'), and SCCS ('SCCS').  These ignored directories will not appear
in the returned list, nor will they be examined in a recursive search.

     getdirs -all rootdir pattern

'-all'
     If this option is given, then subdirectories will be matched
     recursively.

'rootdir'
     The top level directory to start the search from.

'pattern'
     The Tcl glob pattern to match.  If you do not specify 'pattern',
     'getdirs' uses a default pattern of '*'.

relative_filename Procedure
...........................

Return a relative file name, given a starting point.

     relative_filename base destination

'base'
     The starting point for relative file name traversal.

'destination'
     The absolute file name that should be reached by appending the
     return value to base.

find Procedure
..............

Search for files whose names match a glob pattern.  Search
subdirectories recursively, starting at a particular root directory.
The result is the list of files whose names match.  Filenames in the
result include all intervening subdirectory names.  If no files match
the pattern, then an empty string is returned.

     find rootdir pattern

'rootdir'
     The top level directory to start the search from.

'pattern'
     A glob pattern representing the files to find.

which Procedure
...............

Searches the execution path for an executable file like the BSD
'which(1)' utility.  This procedure uses the shell environment variable
'PATH'.  It returns 0 if the binary is not in the path or if the 'PATH'
environment variable is not set.  If the file is in the path, this
procedure returns the full path to the file.

     which file

'file'
     The executable program or shell script to look for.

grep Procedure
..............

Search a named file for lines that contain a match for a regular
expression.  The result is a list of all the lines that match.  If no
lines match, the result is an empty string.  All of the Tcl regular
expression syntax is supported.

     grep -n filename regexp line

'-n'
     The '-n' option prefixes matched lines in the result with the line
     number, just like GNU 'grep' does.  This option should be used in
     preference to the 'line' keyword documented below.

'filename'
     The file to search.

'regexp'
     The Unix style regular expression (as used by the 'grep' UNIX
     utility) to search for.

'line'
     Use the optional keyword 'line' to prefix matched lines in the
     result with the line number.  This usage is deprecated.

prune Procedure
...............

This procedure is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of
DejaGnu.  If a testsuite uses this procedure, a copy of the procedure
should be made and placed in the 'lib' directory of the testsuite.

runtest_file_p Procedure
........................

Search _runtest_s for _testcase_ and return 1 if found, 0 if not.  This
is used by tools like compilers where each testcase is a file.

     runtest_file_p runtests testcase

'runtests'

     'runtests' is a list of two elements.  The second is a copy of what
     was on the right side of the '=' if 'foo.exp="..."' was specified,
     or an empty string if no such argument is present.

'testcase'
     The filename of the current testcase under consideration.

diff Procedure
..............

Compares two files and returns 1 if they match (no differences) or 0 if
not.  If 'verbose' is set, then it will print the differences to the
console.

     diff file1 file2

'file1'
     First file for the comparison.

'file2'
     Second file for the comparison.

setenv Procedure
................

Set an environment variable.

     setenv var val

'var'
     The environment variable to set.

'val'
     The value to set the variable to.

unsetenv Procedure
..................

Unset an environment variable.

     unsetenv var

'var'
     The environment variable to unset.

getenv Procedure
................

Returns the value of the envrionment variable _var_ if it is defined,
otherwise an empty string is returned.

     getenv var

'var'
     Environment variable to retrieve.

*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
